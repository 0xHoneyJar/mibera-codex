# Contract Architecture

*The technical and financial infrastructure of Mibera — a Fully Autonomous Ungovernable Treasury Rave.*

---

## Overview

> *"Mibera's financial model was found at the bottom of a K-hole smoking some Bonklers, with a toke of DeFi summer using Nouns DAO as a butt plug. A Hakim Bey acid dream. A Grateful Dead acid test. A Spiral Tribe freetekno party. A temporary autonomous zone made perpetual, immutably roaming on-chain."*

Mibera combines novel mechanics from multiple protocols to create an entirely new paradigm in NFT space — an innovation on the Bonkler model with unique twists.

## Core Mechanics

### Revenue Distribution

| Source | Allocation |
|--------|------------|
| Mint proceeds | 42% to liquid backing |
| Royalties | 100% to liquid backing |
| Market making revenue share | 100% to liquid backing |
| Lending facility fees | 100% to liquid backing |

### The Liquid Backing System

Every Mibera has intrinsic value backed by the treasury. Holders have two options:

1. **Sell Back to Treasury:** Receive liquid backing value minus a fee
2. **Use as Collateral:** Borrow up to 90% LTV plus a fee via the native lending facility

All fees contribute back to liquid backing — creating perpetual growth mechanics.

## Key Properties

### 1. Number Go Up Technology

The liquid backing of **circulating** Miberas is up-only. While the treasury may shrink due to buybacks or loan defaults, the liquid backing per Mibera in circulation only increases once the rave has started.

### 2. The (9,9) Mechanic

The lending facility is native in-app. Holders can (9,9) — using their Mibera as collateral while maintaining exposure to potential upside.

### 3. Treasury Recycling

When treasury acquires Miberas (through defaults or buybacks), it sells them at liquid backing + premium. All proceeds return to liquid backing.

### 4. The Last Mibera Standing

In the event of a bank run, the last Mibera standing receives the highest liquid backing price. This creates a game theory dynamic where holders at the end want to be last to maximize value — potentially preventing complete bank runs.

### 5. The Eternal Rave

If treasury buys back ALL Miberas, pricing resets to a low price point to kick-start the rave again. The party never truly ends.

### 6. Immutable & Ungovernable

> *"The contracts are immutable. Once we launch, the contract is autonomous and without any admin or governance way to update. This is what is meant by MIBERA IS A FULLY AUTONOMOUS UNGOVERNABLE TREASURY RAVE."*

No admin keys. No governance. Pure autonomous code.

## Technical Stack

The collection combines technology from multiple partners:

| Component | Provider | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Raffle mechanics | THJ | Fair distribution system |
| Launchpad | Scatter | Referrals, whitelisting, mint infrastructure |
| Treasury & Lending | Beramarket | Liquid backing, loan facility, treasury operations |

---

## Mint Structure

### Free Claims

Eligible holders from partner collections can claim free Miberas:
- At least 1 free mint per unique Milady wallet
- Additional collections may be added via new whitelist batches

### Paid Mints

- Extra mints beyond free allocation require payment
- Outsiders (non-holders) pay for all mints

### Anti-Dump Considerations

Even if 50% of collection is given away free:
- Fees from dumps contribute to liquid backing
- Historical data shows high diamond-paw rates for free claims
- Low initial backing grows over time, creating compelling narrative

---

## Elegant Design Properties

The system generates value in any market condition as long as there is movement:

- **Bull market:** Trading volume generates fees
- **Bear market:** Lending facility creates internal movement
- **Defaults:** Treasury acquires cheap Miberas to resell at premium
- **Spread dynamics:** Creates arbitrage opportunities
- **Low volume:** Lending generates activity even when trades are slow

All roads lead to increased liquid backing per circulating Mibera.

## Financial Art

> *"This is chaotic financial art of the highest form."*

Mibera represents a new category: **Financial Art** — where the economic mechanics themselves are part of the artistic statement. The contracts embody the philosophy of the Perpetual Roving Carnival: autonomous, ungovernable, eternal.
