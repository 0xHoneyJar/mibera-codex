**Figures Associated:**

- Kali; a Hindu goddess associated with destruction, transformation, and time. She is often

depicted as fierce, with a dark complexion, multiple arms holding weapons, and a

necklace of skulls, symbolizing her power over death and ego. Despite her fearsome

appearance, Kali is revered as a divine mother who destroys evil and liberates devotees

from ignorance. She is particularly worshipped in Shaktism, a Hindu tradition focused on

the Divine Feminine. Her iconography and myths, like slaying the demon Raktabija,

highlight her role in overcoming chaos and restoring balance. Kali is also linked to

empowerment and spiritual liberation.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**

1. How the British East India company invented the International Drug Trade; The British

East India Company pioneered the international drug trade by systematically cultivating

and exporting opium from India to China in the 18th and 19th centuries. Facing trade

imbalances due to high demand for Chinese goods like tea, the Company expanded

opium production in Bengal, smuggled it into China despite bans, and fueled addiction to

generate massive profits. This led to the Opium Wars, forced trade concessions, and

significant social and economic harm in China, establishing a model for exploitative

global drug trafficking.

that drug use was a significant part of Maya spiritual and cultural practices. The study

highlights how the Maya integrated psychoactive substances into their rituals to connect

with the divine or alter consciousness.

**Figures Associated:**

- Nokomis; Nokomis is a character in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song

of Hiawatha (1855), rooted in Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) oral traditions. She is the

grandmother of Hiawatha, depicted as a wise and nurturing figure who raises him after

his mother, Wenonah, dies. Known as the "Daughter of the Moon," Nokomis falls from

the sky to Earth and serves as a maternal guide, teaching Hiawatha about nature and

life. Her name, derived from the Anishinaabe word for "grandmother" or "my

grandmother," reflects her role as a respected elder in the narrative.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**

1. The rise of Indigenous authors reshaping science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres,

which have historically overlooked Native voices and been dominated by Eurocentric

narratives. Authors like Cherie Dimaline, Waubgeshig Rice, Rebecca Roanhorse, Darice

Little Badger, and Stephen Graham Jones are highlighted for weaving Native American

and First Nations mythology into their works, addressing themes like environmental

degradation, cultural erasure, and historical trauma.

**Here are some of the examples:**

- Cherie Dimaline’s Empire of Wild uses the Métis legend of the rogarou, a

werewolf-like creature, to craft a genre-bending novel about a woman confronting a

devious monster, inspired by stories her grandmother told about real dangers to

Indigenous women

- Waubgeshig Rice’s Moon of the Crusted Snow depicts an Anishinaabe community

facing an apocalyptic collapse, reflecting the "mundane horror" of Indigenous life under

systemic dehumanization.

- Rebecca Roanhorse, of Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo descent, reimagines Native

experiences in futuristic settings, noting that Indigenous peoples have “already survived

an apocalypse,” referring to historical genocides and colonialism.

- Stephen Graham Jones, dubbed the “Jordan Peele of horror literature,” blends

Indigenous identity with horror, as seen in works like The Only Good Indians.

- Grace L. Dillon, an Anishinaabe scholar, coined “Indigenous Futurism,” emphasizing

speculative fiction that envisions Indigenous futures, as showcased in her anthology

Walking the Clouds.

These authors use speculative genres to confront real-world issues like colonialism and

violence against Indigenous communities, gaining recognition in a traditionally white,

male-dominated field.

depictions, which contrasted with the idealized beauty favored by contemporaries like

Utamaro. Despite initial rejection in Edo, Sharaku’s fewer than 160 prints, primarily

yakusha-e (actor portraits), are now considered masterpieces of the ukiyo-e genre,

following an Ital diet (often vegetarian), and using cannabis sacramentally. Rastafari

promotes unity, love, and justice, expressed through reggae music, notably Bob Marley’s

work, and distinctive practices like dreadlocks and the use of Jamaican Patois.

2. The big history of Jamaican music, Raggae. The genre was born in Jamaica in the late

1960s. Emerging from ska and rocksteady, reggae evolved in Kingston’s ghettos,

influenced by Rastafarianism, social issues, and African rhythms. Bob Marley and the

Wailers globalized it in the 1970s with hits like Catch a Fire. Reggae’s offbeat rhythm,

bass-heavy sound, and lyrics addressing oppression, love, and spirituality define its

identity.

1. A Japanese priest has built a techno temple; Gyōsen Asakura, a 49-year-old former DJ

and Buddhist priest, transformed the Shō-onji temple in Fukui City, Japan, into a "techno

temple." To attract younger generations and revive interest in Buddhism, Asakura hosts

"techno memorial services" blending electronic music (IDM and breakbeats) with

traditional Buddhist chants, enhanced by psychedelic light shows and 3D mapping to

represent the Pure Land.

2. Mike Crowley’s book “Secret Drugs of Buddhism”, where he argues that the elixir amrita

(a sacramental drink in Vajrayāna Buddhism) was a psychoactive substance used in

ancient Buddhist practices. Crowley integrates psychedelics sparingly into his practice,

emphasizing meditation to ground insights, and challenges the notion that Buddhism

inherently prohibits mind-altering substances.

1. Indus Valley Civilization (IVC); one of the world’s earliest urban cultures alongside

Mesopotamia and Egypt. Centered around cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, it

featured advanced urban planning, standardized brick architecture, sophisticated

drainage systems, and a script that remains undeciphered. The IVC engaged in trade

with Mesopotamia, using standardized weights and measures, and had a diverse

economy based on agriculture, crafts, and metallurgy. Its society appeared relatively

egalitarian, with no clear evidence of centralized rulership or large-scale conflict. The

civilization declined around 1900 BCE

1. How Hinduism’s cannabis god (Shiva) fuels India’s weed-loving culture. Cannabis,

known as ganja or bhang, has been used for millennia in India and Nepal, particularly

during the Maha Shivaratri festival, where devotees smoke it in chillums or consume it as

bhang to honor Shiva, believed to use it for meditation and spiritual focus. Despite legal

restrictions in India (since the 1980s) and Nepal (since the 1970s), cannabis remains

integral to religious rituals, with government-sanctioned shops in some Indian regions

and Nepal lifting its ban during Maha Shivaratri.
