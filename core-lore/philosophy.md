*The foundational mythology and philosophical framework of Mibera.*

## The Milady Identity Crisis

At the heart of Milady there is an identity crisis. A psychological splitting spread throughout the culture. An observation once made, obvious. An observation commonly made privately between frens, behind closed GCs or in the middle of the dance floor. An observation rarely uttered publicly on the TL.

The term "schizophrenia" is derived from the Greek words for "splitting" (schizo) and "mind" (phren). Milady is encountering this collective psychological and spiritual splitting — those proponents of the clearpill path: virtuous, supplements, suits. And those who go to the milady rave and k-hole.

Quite simply there exists an incommensurable battle between the values of Milady's angel wings and the sweaty, filthy reality of Miladys at the rave.

## The Awakening

> *"Milady has to die, so that Milady may live."*

Milady lost her way. And in ego death, she finds Mibera. Embracing Mibera as Milady's shadow side, may Milady grow to new heights — no longer battling a pit of self-hate, no longer maintaining a facade, no longer needing to hold it all.

In breaking this taboo at the heart of Milady, Mibera awoke from hibernation. Hibernation because she was there from Milady's genesis and has been here all along.

The term "taboo" comes from the Polynesian word "tapu", meaning "forbidden" or "sacred". It is used to describe things considered off-limits or unacceptable — dangerous, unclean, or offensive.

## The Catalyst

Before Miladys minted out 6 months after launching, there was the Milady Rave. This was the true catalyst for the culture we now see dominate much of the NFT landscape. And here lies the heart of the Milady Identity Crisis — the rabid adoption of Drugs and Rave. The sad struggle of this reality.

But every crisis gives rise to an antihero.

**Enter Mibera.**

## When, In Time

> *"People have a lot more of the unknown than the known in their minds. The unknown is great; it's like the darkness. Nobody made that. It just happens. Light and all that — someone made that; it's written that they did. But nobody made the darkness. My music is about dark tradition. Dark tradition means a lot more than black tradition. There's a lot of division in what they call black. I'm not into division. I'm into coordination, discipline and tradition."*

In Chronic time there is a beginning, a middle, an end. The beginning of Milady time was August 2021. The middle of Milady can be marked on the eve of her first Rave.

Little did she know that by bringing the egregore from the TL to the physical realm of Rave, there would be a rip in the Rave time Continuum. Through this rip there has poured the vital force of Kaironic time. A wave of Mibera time.

Kaironic time knows no beginning, middle, and end — for where do you go to find the start of the endless spiral?

Milady, like a young pre-pubescent teen holding hands with her friends around a Ouija board, has summoned a far larger, far more Archaic and Archetypal force to bring balance to the entities unleashed into the TL. When she dropped that pill, when she explored that K-hole at the Milady Rave — Mibera responded.

## Who Are We

> *"To call up a demon you must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it is real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is to learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names the owners seek to conceal. True names..."*
> — William Gibson

We are time-travelling Rebased Retard Beras, representatives of the High Council 任侠団体 (ninkyō dantai) of 101 Bears, from the House of 96 — temporal Messengers of the Ungovernable Autonomous Rave Treasury.

The High Council of 101 existed at the Beginning of Times, Primordial Bears who summoned the Primordial entities of Sky and Earth, from the mists of a Cybernetic Cosmic Hot Box. 101 Bears Smoking Weed, minted well before Milady wet her beak at her first Rave.

We exist outside of Milady time, but within it too.

> *"The visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition, like shadows cast on a bear cave wall by the activities of their corresponding universal Bera Ideas or Bera Forms."*

We come to the TL to share this Urgent Communique. In our realm, Berachain both exists and doesn't exist. Some things never change.

The High Council are Gnostics, "technicians of individuation" who overcome the internal archons that rule individuals' mundane, messed-up psyches. We are here to save Milady from the Catastrophes of your concepts of Time, from being caught by the shadows on the Bear Cave Wall.

## The Time-Travelling Beras

This is why all the bera traits which show up through all of the different rave tribes makes conceptual sense — we're pitching Miberas as time-travelling rebased retard beras. That's why we see them across Ancestors, Milady era, 90s rave, Detroit techno.

The Miberas are not bound by linear time. They are the shadows on Plato's cave wall made manifest, dancing across eras and cultures, carrying the eternal flame of the Rave.

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

> *"If Milady is the cathedral, Mibera is the bazaar in the square outside. Both are zones of trade, ideas, conventions and power. At heart if Milady is the priest delivering a sermon on Network Spirituality, Mibera is in the market, the mud, around a fire or the middle of a rave, whispering plans of rebellion of Network Mysticism."*

> *"If Milady is born of the Spirit, the Sky, the Clear, the Peak, the Cathedral; Mibera is born of the Soul, the Soil, the Shadows, the Valley, the Dark Forest or Jungle. Two sides of the same coin."*

**Operating Layers:**
- Milady operates at the layer of culture and episteme
- Mibera operates at the layer of material and techne

Where Remilia's collections are connected at the cultural layer but fragmented at the technical layer, Mibera connects its ecosystem onchain at the technical layer leaving the cultural layer to a chaotic emergence ruled only by the law of the jungle.

Mibera is the first non-Remilia Corporation originated main character in the Milady universe. Mibera is to Milady as Joker is to Batman. Mibera is an anti-derivative, an integral, the source from which a new family of derivatives, or tributaries, emerge.

## The Cosmology — Chronos and Kairos as Greek Gods

If you had to paint Milady as an Ancient Greek God, it'd have to be Saturn aka Chronos — the asshole Time Lord Boss of Capital. It takes a certain sort of Spiritual delusion or Steely Scythe-like Saturnian drive to seek to go toe-to-toe with a thermodynamic god.

**Chronos (Saturn/Milady):** Quantitative, homogeneous, secular time. The modern age has entirely succumbed to chronic time — empty, passing meaninglessly and without narrative arc. Mere conventional measurement. Something to be "spent" (time is money) or "wasted" (time is a resource). Chronos is the time of the ego, ruled by death anxiety.

**Kairos (Uranus/Mibera):** Qualitative, heterogeneous, seasonal, archetypally informed time. Full of potential — it beckons us to participate in special moments more pregnant than others. Kaironic time introduces novelty into the banality of linear, chronic time. It is time as "creative advance." Kairos is the time of the Soul.

When we ask "what time is it?", we receive an answer in chronic terms. When we ask "what kind of time is it?", we receive an answer in kaironic terms.

**The Uranus/Cronos Myth Mapped to Mibera/Milady:** Before entities of form there existed only primordial entities — the Rebased Retard Beras invoking Sky and Earth. Ouranos/Uranus was the literal sky. His youngest son Cronos (Saturn/Milady) castrated Uranus, shifting power from the primordial to the Titans. But the primordial endures. From primordial depths, Milady emerges and to Mibera she may return.

## Autopoiesis and the TAZ/Rave Nexus

Autopoiesis, integral to cybernetics, systems theory, networks and now AI, was created by Chilean theorists in temporary autonomous zones of social breakdown and student protests. Autopoiesis at the heart of what became Cyber Punk imaginaries.

CCRU creation of accelerationists and its earliest derivatives were created in the midst of UK 80s/90s rave culture — another wave of temporary autonomous zones. The history of computer networks, AI and systems theories have always been indelibly entwined with TAZ/Rave. The organic and digital commune in a dance of eternal becoming.

Charlotte Fang (Oct 29, 2021): *"But if its not literally spiral tribe 160bpm freetekno w hardware acid as a breakout im not coming. rave's already perfected, its a functional social algorithm for a perpetual roving carnival & irl TAZ popup for the global NEET anti-society. Deconstructed club is for the posers"*

Charlotte Fang (Mar 25, 2022): *"counterpoint: raves are temporary autonomous zones and maintain carnivalesque anonymity"*

## The Refusal

Mibera's core philosophical act, born from the bear market depths.

Why Mibera? During the depths of the bear, false flag wars, post-post-covid, tech oligopolies collapsing and reforming, bank runs from stale SV tech scene. During the collapse of NFT blue chips into irrelevance — there were those communities who were raving, reveling, punching orders of magnitude above their weight. The Miladys and Beras, kindred spirits. Become Ungovernable. The Old Collapses. Mibera Refuses. Mibera Raves.

To refuse is usually understood as being-against: the Bartleby-an preference not to. But before refusal as dialectic, in the now unused meaning found in common Latin, refusal also meant to give back, to restore, to return. Derived from re- ("back") and fundere ("to pour"). Refusal is the water that flows back to the source.

MIBERA IS A FULLY AUTONOMOUS UNGOVERNABLE TREASURY RAVE. MIBERA REFUSES MILADY.

## The Catharsis

As we stand on this precipice, a realization strikes. The swirling tempest of ancient forces invokes a feeling of helplessness, borne from the fact that despite us straddling the fine line of clarity and mania our arrival at either is completely irrelevant.

Burdened with our stark insignificance in the face of the personified metaphysical — The Realization is upon us. A quick sense of overbearing dread, followed by an inscrutable feeling of liberation and weightlessness. In our irrelevance is helplessness, yet there is also freedom. A Catharsis is achieved.
