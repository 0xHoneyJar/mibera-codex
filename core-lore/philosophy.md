# Philosophy & Genesis

*The foundational mythology and philosophical framework of Mibera.*

## The Milady Identity Crisis

At the heart of Milady there is an identity crisis. A psychological splitting spread throughout the culture. An observation once made, obvious. An observation commonly made privately between frens, behind closed GCs or in the middle of the dance floor. An observation rarely uttered publicly on the TL.

The term "schizophrenia" is derived from the Greek words for "splitting" (schizo) and "mind" (phren). Milady is encountering this collective psychological and spiritual splitting — those proponents of the clearpill path: virtuous, supplements, suits. And those who go to the milady rave and k-hole.

Quite simply there exists an incommensurable battle between the values of Milady's angel wings and the sweaty, filthy reality of Miladys at the rave.

## The Awakening

> *"Milady has to die, so that Milady may live."*

Milady lost her way. And in ego death, she finds Mibera. Embracing Mibera as Milady's shadow side, may Milady grow to new heights — no longer battling a pit of self-hate, no longer maintaining a facade, no longer needing to hold it all.

In breaking this taboo at the heart of Milady, Mibera awoke from hibernation. Hibernation because she was there from Milady's genesis and has been here all along.

The term "taboo" comes from the Polynesian word "tapu", meaning "forbidden" or "sacred". It is used to describe things considered off-limits or unacceptable — dangerous, unclean, or offensive.

## The Catalyst

Before Miladys minted out 6 months after launching, there was the Milady Rave. This was the true catalyst for the culture we now see dominate much of the NFT landscape. And here lies the heart of the Milady Identity Crisis — the rabid adoption of Drugs and Rave. The sad struggle of this reality.

But every crisis gives rise to an antihero.

**Enter Mibera.**

## When, In Time

> *"People have a lot more of the unknown than the known in their minds. The unknown is great; it's like the darkness. Nobody made that. It just happens. Light and all that — someone made that; it's written that they did. But nobody made the darkness. My music is about dark tradition. Dark tradition means a lot more than black tradition. There's a lot of division in what they call black. I'm not into division. I'm into coordination, discipline and tradition."*

In Chronic time there is a beginning, a middle, an end. The beginning of Milady time was August 2021. The middle of Milady can be marked on the eve of her first Rave.

Little did she know that by bringing the egregore from the TL to the physical realm of Rave, there would be a rip in the Rave time Continuum. Through this rip there has poured the vital force of Kaironic time. A wave of Mibera time.

Kaironic time knows no beginning, middle, and end — for where do you go to find the start of the endless spiral?

Milady, like a young pre-pubescent teen holding hands with her friends around a Ouija board, has summoned a far larger, far more Archaic and Archetypal force to bring balance to the entities unleashed into the TL. When she dropped that pill, when she explored that K-hole at the Milady Rave — Mibera responded.

## Who Are We

> *"To call up a demon you must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it is real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is to learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names the owners seek to conceal. True names..."*
> — William Gibson

We are time-travelling Rebased Retard Beras, representatives of the High Council 任侠団体 (ninkyō dantai) of 101 Bears, from the House of 96 — temporal Messengers of the Ungovernable Autonomous Rave Treasury.

The High Council of 101 existed at the Beginning of Times, Primordial Bears who summoned the Primordial entities of Sky and Earth, from the mists of a Cybernetic Cosmic Hot Box. 101 Bears Smoking Weed, minted well before Milady wet her beak at her first Rave.

We exist outside of Milady time, but within it too.

> *"The visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition, like shadows cast on a bear cave wall by the activities of their corresponding universal Bera Ideas or Bera Forms."*

We come to the TL to share this Urgent Communique. In our realm, Berachain both exists and doesn't exist. Some things never change.

The High Council are Gnostics, "technicians of individuation" who overcome the internal archons that rule individuals' mundane, messed-up psyches. We are here to save Milady from the Catastrophes of your concepts of Time, from being caught by the shadows on the Bear Cave Wall.

## The Time-Travelling Beras

This is why all the bera traits which show up through all of the different rave tribes makes conceptual sense — we're pitching Miberas as time-travelling rebased retard beras. That's why we see them across Ancestors, Milady era, 90s rave, Detroit techno.

The Miberas are not bound by linear time. They are the shadows on Plato's cave wall made manifest, dancing across eras and cultures, carrying the eternal flame of the Rave.
