**Figures Associated:**

- MF Doom; Daniel Dumile, was a British-American rapper and producer, renowned for

his intricate lyricism, unique masked persona, and influential contributions to

underground hip-hop. Born in London and raised in New York, he debuted as Zev Love

X with KMD in the early 1990s, but after his brother’s death and the group’s dissolution,

he reemerged in the late 1990s as MF DOOM, wearing a metal mask inspired by

Marvel’s Doctor Doom.

- Frank Waln; a Sicangu Lakota rapper and music artist from the Rosebud Indian

Reservation in South Dakota, now based in Chicago. A three-time Native American

Music Awards winner, he drew from his childhood influences in classical music and rap

to address themes of reservation life, historical trauma, poverty, and resilience without

appropriation.

- Spiral Tribe, a pioneering UK-based arts collective and nomadic sound system formed

in 1990 by Mark Harrison, Debbie Griffith, and Simone Feeney, blending hardcore

techno, acid house, and breakbeat with New Age traveller and pagan influences to

organize over 30 free parties, raves, and festivals in squatted spaces across England.

- UK Drill Artists and Crews; In a scene structured around pre-existing gang rivalries,

crews bang out not for their city or their borough, but for the fifth and sixth digits of their

phone number. UK drillers invade their rivals’ favoured chicken shops and urinate on

their street signs, while YouTube commenters track skyrocketing ‘scoreboards’ of

stabbings in and around Brixton. Some of the artists involved are: 67, 150, Harlem

Spartans, 410, Zone2, and Abra Cadabra.

- DJ PGZ; a Gunai/Kurnai and Yorta Yorta artist, is a Naarm-based DJ and producer in

techno and EDM. A former drummer and indie band member, he’s passionate about

expanding Blak thought through community events like BLK ICE and filmmaking.

- Digs & Woosh; a DJ duo and key figures in the UK’s DiY Collective, a pivotal group in

the early 1990s free-party and freetekno scene. Based in Nottingham, they helped

organize and perform at illegal raves, including the 1992 Castlemorton Common

Festival, where their hardcore and techno sets contributed to the event’s legendary

status.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**

- DiY Digs & Woosh Illegal Rave in Castlemorton 1992, a massive, unplanned illegal

rave in Worcestershire, UK, that drew ~20,000 attendees after New Age travellers were

redirected from another site. Woosh (Pete Birch, AKA Pete Woosh), is the founding

member of the DiY Collective and one half of the DJ duo Digs & Woosh

- Britain’s Illegal Rave Renaissance; after the first wave of rave culture in the late 1980s

and early 1990s was driven underground by strict laws like the 1994 Criminal Justice

and Public Order Act, a new generation of ravers has revived the scene. Facing a

decline in legal nightlife, with nearly half of UK clubs closing in the decade before 2016,

young people are breaking into abandoned spaces using bolt-cutters and squatting laws

to host underground parties.
