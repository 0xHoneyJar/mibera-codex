## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Sámi people; Indigenous Finno-Ugric people native to Sápmi (northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia). Traditionally reindeer herders, their culture includes 10 distinct languages, joik (traditional singing), and duodji (crafts).

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. Riddu Riddu; an annual international Indigenous festival in northern Norway celebrating Sámi and global Indigenous cultures through music, dance, art, and performances — a vital space for reconnecting with heritage and shamanic practices.

2. Sámi traditional healing; rooted in holistic connection to nature, these practices include herbal remedies, rituals, and spiritual healing led by noaides (shamans), with knowledge passed orally despite suppression by colonization and Christianization.

3. The sacred bear cult; bears were revered as embodying strength and spiritual connection, with complex rituals surrounding their hunt, ceremonial feasting, and burial to honor the bear's spirit and ensure its rebirth.
