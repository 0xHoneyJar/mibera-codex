## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Otyken; Siberian indigenous music group from Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. Members hail from villages along the Chulym River, representing the original inhabitants with distinct cultural identities predating Russian colonization.

- Indigenous Australians; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples spread amongst 250 language groups, the oldest continuous cultures on Earth.

- Stephen Page; Nunukul and Yugambeh descendant who became artistic director of Bangarra Dance Theatre, blending traditional Indigenous stories with contemporary dance.

- Paul Gorrie (DJ PGZ); Blak artist and Naarm-based DJ blending techno with Indigenous cultural elements. He sees techno as a space for Blak expression, reflecting its ties to Queer and Black struggles.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. Aboriginal Dreamtime; "The Dreaming" is the foundational Aboriginal belief system encompassing creation stories, spiritual connections to land, and ancestral knowledge. Dreamtime involves experiences akin to astral projection — entering dreamlike states to connect with ancestors, spirits, and the cosmos. Concentric circle symbols represent these spiritual journeys.

2. The Rise of the Indigenous Art Market; in 2007, Emily Kame Kngwarreye's work became the first Indigenous art sold for over $1 million. That same year, Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri's "Warlugulong" reached $2.4 million, signaling global recognition of Aboriginal artistic traditions.
