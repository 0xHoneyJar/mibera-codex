## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Sharaku; mysterious ukiyo-e print designer active only from 1794-1795, renowned for psychologically intense portraits of kabuki actors. His true identity remains unknown, and his unflattering, realistic style was initially rejected but is now considered masterful.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Techno Temple; Gyōsen Asakura, a former DJ turned Buddhist priest, transformed Shō-onji temple in Fukui City into a "techno temple." He hosts "techno memorial services" blending IDM and breakbeats with traditional Buddhist chants, using psychedelic light shows to represent the Pure Land.

2. Japanese rave culture; Tokyo's underground club scene from the 1990s onward blended Western electronic music with Japanese aesthetics, creating a unique fusion that influenced global dance music.
