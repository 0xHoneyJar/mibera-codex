# Arabs

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- The Nabataeans; ancient Arab people who built the rose-red city of Petra and controlled incense trade routes. Masters of water engineering in the desert, they blended Arab, Greek, and Egyptian influences.

- Omar Souleyman; Syrian dabke musician who brought Arab wedding party music to global festivals. His hypnotic, repetitive electronic dabke became a staple of experimental club scenes worldwide.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Coffee Revolution; coffee cultivation began in Yemen around the 15th century, spreading through Sufi monasteries where it aided nightlong spiritual practices. Coffeehouses (qahveh khaneh) became centers of intellectual exchange across the Arab world.

2. The Golden Age of Islam (8th-14th century); Arab scholars preserved Greek philosophy while advancing mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and alchemy. This knowledge later sparked the European Renaissance.
