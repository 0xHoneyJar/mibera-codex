# Bong Bear

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Smokey The Bera & Papa Bear; two pseudonymous OlympusDAO community members who created the original Bong Bears collection in 2021. What began as 107 NFTs of bears smoking bongs (priced at 0.069420 ETH) evolved into Berachain — a novel L1 blockchain that raised $142 million from investors including Polychain Capital and Framework Ventures.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Bong Bears origin story; launched in 2021 as a playful NFT collection by OlympusDAO degens, Bong Bears unexpectedly became the foundation for Berachain — proving how meme culture and genuine innovation can coexist in crypto. The collection's irreverent humor attracted a dedicated builder community.

2. The Rebase mechanism; Bong Bear holders received airdrops of subsequent collections — Bond Bears, Boo Bears, Baby Bears, Band Bears, and Bit Bears — creating a unique loyalty system. With only 4,713 NFTs across all collections, these function as "founder passes" within the Berachain ecosystem.

3. The BERA airdrop; 6.9% of Berachain's total token supply (34.5 million BERA) was allocated to Bong Bear and rebase collection holders — rewarding early believers and cementing the NFTs' status as blue-chip crypto assets.
