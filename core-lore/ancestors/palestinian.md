# Palestinian

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Mahmoud Darwish; Palestine's most celebrated poet, whose verses of exile, longing, and resistance became anthems of Palestinian identity. His work transcends politics to explore universal themes of displacement and belonging.

- DJ Khaled; Palestinian-American DJ and producer whose catchphrases and collaborative hits made him a global hip-hop icon. Born to Palestinian immigrant parents, he represents diaspora success.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Keffiyeh as global symbol; the black-and-white checkered scarf, traditionally worn by Palestinian farmers, became an icon of solidarity and resistance worldwide. Adopted by activists from the 1960s onward, it signifies Palestinian identity and anti-colonial struggle.

2. Dabke; the traditional Levantine line dance performed at weddings and celebrations. Dancers link arms or hold hands, stomping in synchronized patterns — a living connection to village traditions maintained in exile.

**Fashion Icons / Symbolism:** Keffiyeh, thobe (traditional embroidered dress), tatreez embroidery patterns, olive branch, key symbol (representing the right of return)
