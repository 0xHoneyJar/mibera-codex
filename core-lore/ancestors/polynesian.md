# Polynesian

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Israel Kamakawiwoʻole (IZ); beloved Hawaiian musician whose ukulele rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" became an anthem of gentle resistance. His music embodied Hawaiian sovereignty and cultural pride.

- Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson; Samoan-American actor and former wrestler who has brought Polynesian culture to mainstream audiences, proudly displaying his pe'a (traditional Samoan tattoo).

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Polynesian Wayfinding Renaissance; ancient Polynesians navigated thousands of miles across the Pacific using stars, waves, and bird patterns — no instruments. The Hōkūleʻa voyaging canoe revived this tradition in the 1970s, sparking cultural renewal.

2. Ta Moko and Tatau; Polynesian tattooing traditions carry genealogy, rank, and spiritual protection. Māori ta moko (facial tattoos) and Samoan pe'a are sacred practices that have influenced global tattoo culture.

**Fashion Icons / Symbolism:** Tapa cloth patterns, tiki carvings, tribal tattoo motifs, lei flower garlands, bone hook pendants
