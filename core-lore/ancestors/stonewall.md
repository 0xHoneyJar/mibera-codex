# Stonewall

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Marsha P. Johnson; Black trans activist and self-identified drag queen who was at the forefront of the Stonewall uprising. She co-founded STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) with Sylvia Rivera to support homeless trans youth.

- Sylvia Rivera; Latina trans activist who fought alongside Marsha P. Johnson and continued advocating for trans rights until her death in 2002. Often erased from mainstream LGBTQ+ narratives, she represents the radical roots of queer liberation.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Stonewall Uprising (June 28, 1969); when police raided the Stonewall Inn, patrons — led by trans women of color, drag queens, and butch lesbians — fought back. Six days of protests followed, sparking the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.

2. The first Pride marches (1970); on the one-year anniversary of Stonewall, the first Gay Pride marches were held in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. What began as protest became the global Pride tradition.

**Fashion Icons / Symbolism:** Stonewall shirt, rainbow flag (created 1978), liberation buttons, protest signs, leather and denim
