## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Daoist traditions; Chinese shamans (wu) used hallucinogens to enter trance states for spiritual communication, with practices dating back thousands of years.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. Battle of Palikao (1860); a decisive Second Opium War engagement where Anglo-French forces defeated the Qing dynasty near Beijing, leading to the looting of the Old Summer Palace and harsh treaty terms including territorial concessions.

2. Ancient Chinese shamanic drug use; texts like "Guideways Through Mountains" reference "Shaman Mountain" where drug-yielding plants grew. Shamans (wu) used hallucinogens for trance states until banned by the Song dynasty, though some ethnic groups continued using psychoactive herbs.

3. Psychedelics in Daoist practice; cannabis was used since Neolithic times, and references exist to shaman priestesses transforming into psychedelic mushrooms — showing deep integration of entheogens in Chinese spirituality.
