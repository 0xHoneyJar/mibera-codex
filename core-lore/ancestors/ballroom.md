# Ballroom

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Crystal LaBeija; founding mother of ballroom culture who broke from mainstream pageants to create the House of LaBeija in 1972. She rejected white beauty standards and built a space for Black and Latinx queer expression.

- Willi Ninja; the legendary "Godfather of Voguing" whose angular movements influenced Madonna's "Vogue" video and brought ballroom to mainstream culture. Featured prominently in "Paris Is Burning."

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The House System; ballroom "houses" function as chosen families for LGBTQ+ youth, often rejected by biological families. House mothers and fathers provide guidance, community, and compete together at balls — a revolutionary model of queer kinship.

2. Voguing; the dance form born in Harlem ballrooms, characterized by angular poses inspired by fashion magazines, dramatic dips, and acrobatic "death drops." From underground culture to global phenomenon, voguing embodies Black queer resilience and creativity.
