## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Nokomis; a character in Longfellow's epic poem "The Song of Hiawatha" (1855), rooted in Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) oral traditions. Known as the "Daughter of the Moon," she is Hiawatha's wise grandmother who guides him through nature and life. Her name derives from the Anishinaabe word for "grandmother."

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The rise of Indigenous Futurism; Native authors are reshaping speculative fiction with works rooted in Indigenous mythology. Cherie Dimaline uses Métis rogarou legends, Waubgeshig Rice depicts Anishinaabe apocalypse survival, Rebecca Roanhorse notes Indigenous peoples "already survived an apocalypse," and Stephen Graham Jones blends identity with horror. Grace L. Dillon coined the term "Indigenous Futurism" for this movement.
