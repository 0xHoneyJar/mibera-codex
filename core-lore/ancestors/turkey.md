# Turkey

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Barış Manço; legendary Turkish rock musician who blended Anatolian folk with psychedelic rock in the 1970s. His flamboyant style and TV show made him a beloved national icon.

- Göbekli Tepe builders; the unknown people who constructed the world's oldest known temple complex around 9500 BCE in southeastern Turkey, predating Stonehenge by 6,000 years and rewriting human prehistory.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. Turkish Hammam culture; the Ottoman bathhouse tradition blending Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic bathing practices. Hammams served as social centers for cleansing, relaxation, and community gathering — a tradition that influenced spas worldwide.

2. The Psychedelic Anatolian Rock scene; in the 1960s-70s, Turkish musicians fused Western rock with traditional Anatolian scales and instruments like the saz. Banned and suppressed after the 1980 military coup, this music is now rediscovered globally.
