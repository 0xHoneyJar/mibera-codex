## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Tenzing Norgay; Sherpa mountaineer who, alongside Edmund Hillary, became the first to summit Mount Everest in 1953. A symbol of Himalayan resilience and the Sherpa people's extraordinary high-altitude abilities.

- The Kumari; living goddesses selected from young Newar girls in Kathmandu. The Kumari tradition blends Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, with the girl serving as a vessel for the goddess Taleju until puberty.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Hippie Trail and Freak Street; in the 1960s-70s, Kathmandu's Freak Street became a legendary destination on the overland hippie trail from Europe to Asia. Legal hashish shops, cheap lodging, and spiritual seeking drew thousands of Western counterculture travelers.

2. Mad Honey (Grayanotoxin); Himalayan cliff bees produce honey from rhododendron nectar that causes mild hallucinations and intoxication. Nepali Gurung honey hunters scale dangerous cliffs to harvest this "mad honey," a tradition thousands of years old.
