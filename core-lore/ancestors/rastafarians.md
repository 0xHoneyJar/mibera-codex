## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Lee "Scratch" Perry; Jamaican producer pivotal in shaping reggae and dub music. He pioneered dub at his Black Ark studio in the 1970s, producing for Bob Marley and others. Known for eccentric style, spiritual beliefs blending Rastafarianism with mysticism, and experimental techniques using reverb and sampling.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. Rastafari; a spiritual movement emerging in 1930s Jamaica, blending Old Testament theology with Pan-Africanism. It emphasizes black empowerment, resistance to "Babylon" (colonial oppression), and repatriation to "Zion" (Africa/Ethiopia). Key practices include Ital diet, sacramental cannabis, and dreadlocks.

2. The birth of Reggae; emerging from ska and rocksteady in late 1960s Kingston, reggae was shaped by Rastafarianism, social issues, and African rhythms. Bob Marley and the Wailers globalized it in the 1970s, making its offbeat rhythm and bass-heavy sound a worldwide phenomenon.
