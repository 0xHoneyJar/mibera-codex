# Haitian

## Cultural Significance

**Figures Associated:**
- Toussaint Louverture; leader of the Haitian Revolution, the only successful slave revolt in history. A former slave who became a military genius, he laid the groundwork for Haiti becoming the first free Black republic in 1804.

- Maya Deren; Ukrainian-American filmmaker and anthropologist whose documentary "Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti" (1985) captured Vodou ceremonies. She became an initiated practitioner herself.

**Events Associated / Significant Cultural Impact:**
1. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804); the only successful slave rebellion that led to an independent nation. Beginning with the Bois Caïman Vodou ceremony, enslaved Africans overthrew French colonial rule, inspiring abolition movements worldwide.

2. Vodou (Voodoo); a syncretic religion blending West African Vodun with Catholic elements. Central to Haitian identity, it features lwa (spirits), possession rituals, and communal ceremonies with drumming and dance. Far from Hollywood stereotypes, it's a complex spiritual system.
