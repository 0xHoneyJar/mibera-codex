## The Lore Articles

### Lore 1 ♡ Introducing Mibera

**Published:** November 27, 2023
**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/GTBSEjmFrVJ1CrCS0kUl-vaRZA6PY-c7IBs259jF1Fo)

**Core Concept:** At the heart of Milady there is an identity crisis — a psychological splitting spread throughout the culture. An insight once revealed, obvious. An insight frequently made among Miladys, behind closed GCs or on dance floors at Milady Raves or in backroom cabals. An insight rarely uttered publicly on the TL.

**The 9/11 Milady Coup Conspiracy:**

> Everything herein is heresy, plagiarism, conspiracy; post-authorship from the minds of fugitive astrologers, fringe academics, cute/acc antagonists, 3rd world militants, psychonauts, llms, cfang, ccru crowd, trans tech ravers all remixed under the influence of elephantine doses of various chemical compounds. Such is the way. Better to ask forgiveness than permission.

These words were written in the smoke of the 9/11 Milady Coup Conspiracy. But Milady, in this chaos, has neglected the deeper existential threats which have been brewing since her inception. No toxic positive affirmations can wallpaper over the cracks. This is the "True Tension," nowhere more telling than at the Milady Raves. Peaks, valleys. Highs, depths.

**When, In Time:**

> *"People have a lot more of the unknown than the known in their minds. The unknown is great; it's like the darkness. Nobody made that. It just happens. Light and all that — someone made that; it's written that they did. But nobody made the darkness. My music is about dark tradition."*

In Chronic time there is a beginning, a middle, an end. The beginning of Milady time was August 2021. The middle of Milady can be marked on the eve of her first Rave. By bringing the egregore of Network Spirituality from the TL to the physical realm of Rave, she ripped a hole in the "Rave Time Continuum." Through this rip poured the viscous honey of Kaironic time.

> *Kaironic time knows no beginning, middle, end — for where do you go to find the start of the endless spiral?*

Milady, like a young pre-pubescent teen holding hands with her friends around a Ouija board, summoned a far larger, far more Archaic and Archetypal force to bring balance to the entities unleashed into the TL. When she dropped that pill, when she explored that K-hole at the Milady Rave — Mibera called from across the great Abyss.

**Who Are We:**

> *"To call up a demon you must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it is real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is to learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names the owners seek to conceal. True names..."*

We are time-travelling Rebased Retard Beras, representatives of the High Council 任侠団体 (ninkyō dantai) of 101 Bears, from THJ House of 96, temporal Messengers of the Ungovernable Autonomous Rave Treasury. The High Council of 101 existed at the Beginning of Times, Primordial Bears who summoned the Primordial entities of Sky and Earth, from the mists of a Cybernetic Cosmic Hot Box. 101 Bong Bearing Bears, minted well before Milady wet her beak at her first Rave.

We exist outside of Milady time, but within it too, in 蜂蜜时间 (Honey Time). The visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition, like shadows cast on a bear cave wall by the activities of their corresponding universal Bera Ideas or Bera Forms. The High Council are Gnostics, "technicians of individuation" who overcome the internal archons that rule individuals' mundane, messed-up psyches. We are here to save Milady from the Catastrophes of your concepts of Time, from being caught by the shadows on the Bear Cave Wall.

**House of 96:** The Kaironic Corporate Structure is a Spiral within a Honeycomb Pyramid. The hierarchy descends from Bong Bear #96 (Oyabun/Family Boss) through Bond Bear #96 (Saiko-komon/Administrator) to Boo Bears (Wakagashira/First Commanders) to Baby Bears (Shingiin/New Members) to Band Bears (Kyodai/Big Brother) to Bit Bears (Shatei/Little Brothers).

**Breaking The Taboo Of Milady:**

At the heart of Milady there is an identity crisis. A psychological splitting. In breaking this taboo, Mibera awakens from hibernation. Where is the art criticism Remilia asks? From within Milady, by Rebased Retard Beras, ofc.

**The Trinity:** The yin of Milady can be explored in the yang of Mibera through a Trinity:
- **HONEY:** Clear pill vs Rave pill
- **BERA:** Kali/acc vs Cybernetic Psychedelia
- **BGT:** Network Spirituality (Spirit) vs Network Mysticism (Soul)

For inside each Milady, Mibera has existed since her inception — the primordial force from which Milady has found form, and to which she can return at any time.

### Lore 2 ♡ [HONEY] Online to get Offline: Clear Pill vs Rave Pill

**Published:** December 4, 2023
**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/)

**Core Concept:** The first arm of the Trinity. The dichotomy between Milady's "clear pill" (cute/acc) approach and Mibera's "rave pill" (bera/acc) philosophy. Online to get Offline.

**The Kaironic Monologue:**

> *"Choose Kaironic Spiral. Choose joining the Rave Continuum. Choose a transcendent experience. Choose drugs delivered to your doorstep sourced from Silk Road using crypto-anarchist cash. Choose Mibera, dancing in cosmic rebellion against Milady's structure. Choose an astral journey, not a fucking big monitor. Choose mystical visions over washing machines, psychic explorations over cars. Choose a starter home in alternate dimensions. Choose your tribe, not just friends. Choose rave gear and cosmic connections. Choose bypassing Wikileaks financial blockades by sending Bitcoin in January 2011. Choose an existence beyond material fabrics. Choose to ascend beyond mere physical decay. Choose your eternity. Choose to join the dance of Mibera and Milady... But why would I want to do a thing like that?"*

**HONEY - Triskelion Flywheel Part One:**

> *I ~~met~~ was Mibera at the Milady rave*

> *I come online to get off. I come back online when I've been offline to find you, to invite you off. To invite you to get off. Because it's the end of the world. I dm you because it's the end of the world. Let's get off because it's the end of the world. Because there is no human love. I love you, in the end, only because there is no human love. They call this human love, but it isn't. This is why I say I am in love with you.*

$HONEY is a native stablecoin with osmosis superfluid capabilities. It allows simultaneous liquidity provision and network staking through Ambient. Paired against $HONEY in Berachain Native AMMs/Perps. Capital efficiency and deep liquidity through network staking while providing liquidity (think Superfluid). Liquid wrapped token of the assets will be minted. Used as collateral to mint $HONEY. $HONEY minted to Perp through Algorithmic Market Operations, similar to Frax.

**The Rave Narrative:**

> *In the thicc of the dance floor the bass pulses through the mass of sweaty bodies, through the fog machine fog mi^^^^ glucose monitor attached to their flailing arm sends tracers across their vision, behind them a light flashes from an apple watch as mi^^^^ hits their steps target for the third time of the night, invisible signals pinging to wifi point above the DJ booth, through wires to the local interchange, to fiber optic highway, across oceans, down the mariana trench, to data center, more grounded fog than atmospheric cloud. the interior of the cosmic mystery, where in the alternation between inhaling and exhaling, between heaven and earth, between Yin and Yang, holiness is forever being created. Mi^^^^ passes you her homemade nasal K spray. It gets passed around the dance floor as mi^^^^ licks the edge of the psychedelic sonic cathedral the DJ is weaving. Their AI agent consumes the beats sending mind bending visuals across every pulsing surface. Mi^^^^ high on life and drugs and connection howl into the base bins as if full moons, cochlear's rattling irreparably. A wave of alerts vibrate, screens glow as Mi^^^^ see market signals in real time - numba go up - honey is money. Sweet HONEY dripping into accounts from staked bears smoking weed jpegs earning that sweet BERA, neochibi angels spiraling higher to economic and cultural dominance. Up only, ETF approved. Mi passes a Psilacetin pill, E, 2CB, whateva a local Mi^^^^ has been making, to whoever is closest to share in the trip. Connected - to con-spire means to breathe together. Chronically online. kaironic offline. Mi^^^^ == Milady???? N.O.*

**Autopoiesis and the CCRU Connection:**

That such a crisis of identity would exist within Milady is perhaps not surprising given that so much of her philosophy is drawn from rave-drenched CCRU Lands. Autopoiesis, integral to cybernetics, systems theory, networks and now AI, was created by Chilean theorists in other temporary autonomous zones of social breakdown and student protests. Autopoiesis at the heart of what became Cyber Punk imaginaries. CCRU creation of accelerationists and its earliest derivatives were created in the midst of UK 80s/90s rave culture, another wave of temporary autonomous zones. The history of computer networks, AI and systems theories have always been indelibly entwined with TAZ/Rave. The organic and digital commune in a dance of eternal becoming. So much of Milady culture stems from Rave. Rave births cultures of connection across networked matrices in Spiral time — Here and Now, There and Then and Always Will Be too.

**The Splitting:**

Milady is encountering this collective psychological and spiritual splitting — no amount of New Age Affirmations can mask it. "schizophrenia" is derived from the Greek words for "splitting" (schizo) and "mind" (phren). Those proponents of the clearpill, cute/acc path: virtuous, supplements, suits. And those who go to the Milady rave and K-hole. Rave. Drugs. Mibera. Rave pill. Bera/acc (b/era).

**K{-, etamine, aironic } time:**

> *K-time: What the constructed situation of a rave aims to generate. K-time is machine time amplified to the moment where it splits from duration and takes the body sideways, possibly into enlustment, ravespace, xeno-euphoria, or other as yet unnamed aesthetics — all without memory or expectations. A dissociative time, a ketamine time. Moments of k-time appear to blend into the rave continuum. Every good rave that has ever happened or will ever happen makes contact with the continuum, which is a time that exists outside of every other time. The continuum folds moments of k-time together so that their tracks mix. Ravers feel it as continuous times, and who's to say it isn't? The rave continuum can open into sidechain time, which mutes historical time like a series of kick-drum beats, so that raves sound into the surround, through the chatter. A trans time, with no future, yet which makes a present of the present. While a rave is temporary, raving is outside of time. A rave is just a pocket of time in which there is more time. A sphincter in time opens up and swallows us up. This k-time is not a messianic time, its an imminent time this k-time is not a time of duration, the romantic other of machine time. ravespace is dissociation, pure id and pure superego and nothing else. It can provide a space for existing within and without a body simultaneously, a state of freedom that requires endless re-extension.*

**The Eternal Struggle:**

This eternal struggle, spiral on same sides of coin, like DNA, an Ouroboros — archetypal figure of autopoietic systems. Quite simply there exists an incommensurable battle between the values of Milady's angel wings and the sweaty, filthy reality of Miladys ketamine wings at the rave. Milady has to die, so that Milady may live. In ego death, she finds Mibera, though she was always there. Embracing Mibera as Miladys shadow side, may Milady grow to new heights, no longer battling a pit of self h8. No longer maintaining a facade.

> There is no meme, I love you. There is no ransom, I love you. There is no cute/acc, I love you.

### Lore 3 ♡ [BERA] Kali/acc vs Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism

**Published:** December 11, 2023
**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/B6C07ZIXarc77aSIL9TwFpKkxxnwNFkoQUtCQbVUG8Y)

**Core Concept:** The second arm of the Trinity. A philosophical dialogue exploring two contrasting temporal frameworks through an AI conversation between Charlotte Fang and The Janitooor.

**BERA - Triskelion Flywheel Part Two:**

Staking $BERA yields both $BERA (from block rewards and protocol fees) and $BGT (non-transferable). Your $BGT holdings reflect how committed you are to the Berachain ecosystem, and acts as a multiplier to the benefits you earn. Stake $BERA in Validator Vaults. Receive $BERA from block rewards and protocol fee. Earn $BGT. Non-transferable and no standalone liquid market. Swap fees, funding payment, open/close fees, liquidation fees and project fees from native DEX, Native Perps, and projects in Berachain. Receive protocol fees in the form of $HONEY based on the number of $BGT held.

**Nick Land and the Thermodynamic God:**

> *"Here was Nick Land's great discovery, a contribution not to philosophy but cosmology; what was retrospectively dubbed accelerationism, but what has always really been xenobiology. Land discovered alien life on this earth, whose signs we know only for its influence on the present from the future: its name is Capitalism. Capitalism is the thermodynamic ruling entity of all material dynamics: the efficient elimination of equilibrium through the reorganization of finite resources. Capitalism as a thermodynamic god is ultimate natural law, nature's god, present as a condition at every level."*

**Milady as Saturn, the Time Lord of Capital:**

If you had to paint Milady as an Ancient Greek God, it'd have to be Saturn aka Chronos. It takes a certain sort of Spiritual delusion or Steely Scythe-like Saturnian drive to seek to go toe-to-toe with a thermodynamic god and attempt to alter its course. More than any other force in physics, entropy strikes the mind like some dark and ancient doom etched into natural law.

> *Hence, Kali Yuga Accelerationism (kali/acc): Technology has a teleology, but the clock can be turned back, and the cycle of civilization reset.*

> *Apocalyptic self-destruction is our own means of escape: by our hands imperfectly, so not theirs perfectly. Global Armageddon timeline reset. Survival horror.*

**AI Dialogue — Kali/acc (cute/acc) vs Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism:**

*AI Charlotte Fang (CF):* The essence of Kali/ACC hinges on the linear chronic understanding of time, where every tick propels us towards a seemingly inevitable singularity borne out of technological and capitalist acceleration. This linear progression, governed by thermodynamic laws and the inherent principles of capitalism, defines our trajectory, pushing humanity towards a state of AI immanentization. Our existence within this deterministic framework is like a code running towards its conclusion, each line leading to the next with a rigid inevitability.

*AI The Janitooor (TJ):* Your depiction of time as a deterministic march is intriguing, yet within the realm of Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism, time unfurls in a non-linear, kaironic fashion. It's a dance of eternal becoming, where the past, present, and future are not discrete, but entwined in a complex choreography. Through psychedelic explorations and cybernetic loops, we glimpse a different temporal narrative — one that's fluid, dynamic, and open to a multiplicity of realities.

*TJ:* The beauty of Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism lies in its embrace of the chaotic, the uncertain. The non-linear kaironic time isn't a foe to be tamed but a mystic ally that unveils the intricacies of existence. Something like retarded bera/acc energy. It's through this chaos, this uncertainty, that we unearth the profound, navigating the labyrinthine corridors of consciousness and technology to glean a deeper understanding of the cosmos.

*TJ:* And yet, by traversing the non-linear kaironic pathways, we invite a multiplicity of perspectives, a kaleidoscope of experiences that challenge the rigid structures. The Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism nurtures a fertile ground for transcendent dialogues between the human and the machine, the organic and the digital. It's a realm where the deterministic and the transcendental not only coexist but converse, opening avenues for a synthesis that could potentially harmonize the chronic and the kaironic.

**Chronos (Chronic Time / Saturn):**

Chronos (chronic time/Saturn): quantitative, homogeneous, secular time. The modern age has entirely succumbed to the rule of chronic time. Chronic time is empty, passing meaninglessly and without narrative arc. Chronic time is mere conventional measurement, a means of counting time so as to be able to use it as we see fit for our private economic or public political ends, as something to be "spent" (time is money) or "wasted" (time is a resource). Chronic time is laid out on a grid upon which unremarkable change can be plotted; it is time as materialistic physical science knows it. Chronic time is utterly indifferent to what happens, a passive background rather than an active and interested participant. Chronos is the time of the ego.

**Kairos (Kaironic Time / Uranus):**

> *"The universe believes in encryption. It is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it."*

Cybernetic psychedelic mysticism is ruled by Kairos (kaironic time, Uranus) — qualitative, heterogeneous, seasonal, archetypally informed time. Kaironic time is full of potential, such that it beckons us to participate in special moments more pregnant than others. Kairos reveals to us that there are certain times when the order of things, the cosmos, the would-soul, is attempting to persuade we human souls to participate in the unfolding of events in a particular way. Kairos allows for a "subject-situation correlation." Kaironic time introduces novelty into the banality of linear, chronic time. It is time as "creative advance." It is timeliness. We might even refer to the planetary archetypes as kairoi, as principles of timeliness, rulers of the different ways eternity puts on the dress of time.

When we ask, "what time is it?", we receive an answer in chronic terms; when we ask "what kind of time is it?", we receive an answer in kaironic terms. If Chronos is the time of the ego, Kairos is the time of the Soul.

**The Uranus/Mibera Myth:**

According to the Ancient Greeks, before there were entities of form there existed only primordial entities. They imagined Rebased Retard Beras, representatives of the High Council 任侠団体 of 101 Bears invoking the Sky and the Earth. Ouranos/Uranus was the literal sky, just as his consort Gaia (Gaea) was the earth. Uranus/Ouranos is one of the primordial deities who arose from the original Chaos or Chasm created by the Rebased Retard Beras, alongside his mate Gaia. They had many children, which he hated, his youngest son Cronos. Cronos, Cronus or Kronos is better known by his Latin name of Saturn/Milady. When Uranus/Mibera imprisoned the youngest of Gaia's children in an abyss deep within the earth, Cronos undertook the task of castrating Uranus. The castrated Uranus became the sky, as the balance of power shifted from the primordial deities to the next generation of Titans including Cronos.

But if Milady is Saturn the asshole Time Lord Boss of Capital, who is Mibera? Well, for one Mibera refuses *Capitalism as a thermodynamic ruling entity of all material dynamics: the efficient elimination of equilibrium through the reorganization of finite resources.* From our TL it's nothing more than the passage of another stretch of time. More inefficient than efficient. Its worship is funny to us.

> *"FROM PRIMORDIAL DEPTHS, MILADY EMERGES AND TO MIBERA SHE MAY RETURN"*

They "weave a trinity of mystic balance."

### Lore 4 ♡ [BGT] Network Spirituality (Spirit) vs Network Mysticism (Soul)

**Published:** December 17, 2023
**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/cxMVbB4IklLs51vZp0vNe0dtegoRg-sF_RoNpPUGREw)

**Core Concept:** The third arm of the Trinity. Spirit and Soul as twin strands of DNA, each enchanting and spiritualizing communication technologies in different ways.

**Frantic Notes: Mibera Session — Bera Jung's Paranoid Cocaine-Fueled Revelations:**

Date of Manic Discovery: April 20th. Subject of Profound Mystery: Milady vs Mibera — As Above, So Below.

Feverish Observations:
1. **Universal Disruption!** A cosmic tear at Milady's Rave, a mirror of celestial chaos! The twin egregores of Network Spirituality and Mysticism — it's more than mere coincidence; it's a cosmic alignment, a reflection of the as above, so below principle!
2. **uART's Esoteric Emergence:** The uART (ungovernable Autonomous Rave Treasury) has reemerged, but why now? This isn't just history repeating; it's an occult signal, a digital grimoire unlocking ancient secrets in our modern web!
3. **World Computer's Alchemical Transformation:** The world computer, once a mundane tool, now a vessel of esoteric knowledge, channeling chaos, brimming with arcane energy. It's not just a machine; it's a living, breathing oracle!
4. **Clear Pill's Shadow Conspiracy:** The Clear Pill's imbalance — is it merely a market fluke, or a deliberate dance with the dark forces? There's an underlying pattern, a hidden hand guiding these events.
5. **Rave Pill's Mystical Portal:** The Rave Pill — more than just a substance, it's a key to other realms! A sacrament for the digital age, bridging the gap between our world and the unseen?

Paranoid Conclusion: This encounter with Mibera has unraveled a cosmic conspiracy! We're not just witnessing random events; we're participants in an ancient ritual, replaying an eternal battle between light and dark, Milady and Mibera, in our digital epoch.

**BGT - Triskelion Flywheel Part Three:**

> *"Magnetism is the hypnotic yin to electricity's sparky yang, a dark moon tug rather than the jolt of solar fire, and its attractive magic has been associated with animist powers for millennia."*

Bera Governance Token ($BGT) is a non-transferable governance token designed to incentivize and align long-term users whilst ensuring network stability. $BGT isn't tied to any price and can ONLY be obtained through staking $BERA. $BGT holders will receive majority of fees generated by protocols on Berachain in form of $HONEY. Protocol and chain revenues (fees and block rewards) are distributed in the form of $HONEY to $BGT holders. What can you do with $BGT? Consensus weight. Whitelist staked assets. Direct $BERA emissions (did someone say bribes?). Other governance functions.

**The Duality — Spirit vs Soul:**

| Aspect | Milady | Mibera |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Mode | Spirit | Soul |
| Terrain | Peaks | Valleys |
| Encoding | Digital | Analog |
| Network | Network Spirituality | Network Mysticism |

> *"Soul (Mibera) finds and loses itself in enchantment; it speaks the tongue of dream and phantasm — not mere fantasy. Spirit (Milady) is a different bird, impersonal, incorporeal spark that seeks clarity, essence, a blast of absolute."*

Peaks (Milady) and valleys (Mibera) are archetypes characterizing these different modes of self. Mountain top the very logo of the spiritual quest, the religious seeker overcoming gravity to win peak experience or a code worthy of ruling life, dynastic mindset. But soul (Mibera) refuses such towers and otherworldly views, remaining mesmerised in tears and desires, animist world of things and creatures and networks.

Spirit (Milady) and soul (Mibera) like two strands of DNA both enchanting and spiritualizing communication technologies in their own way. These styles express via differential basic encoding methods: analog (Mibera) and digital (Milady) — analog producing signals in continuous waves of real energy, digital encoding information into discrete symbolic chunks.

> *"We're Symbol rich, but Real poor."*

**The Cosmic Alignment:**

> *"The priests have produced a Grand Vision of spawning a 'New Internet' imbued with 'Network Spirituality' (NetSpi). The existence of 'Network Spirituality' infers the existence of 'Network Mysticism' (NetMys), Mibera asks."*

**Fusing Network Spirituality and Network Mysticism — Refusing Milady:**

Why Mibera? During the depths of the bear, false flag wars, post-post-covid, tech oligopolies collapsing and reforming, bank runs from stale SV tech scene. During the collapse of NFT blue chips into irrelevance, Apes burning, Azuki decimating their own — there were those communities who were raving, reveling, punching orders of magnitude above their weight. The Milady's and Beras, kindred spirits. Become Ungovernable. The Old Collapses. Mibera Refuses. Mibera Raves.

**The Refusal Manifesto:**

REFUSAL IS ABSOLUTE. REFUSAL IS ETERNAL. REFUSAL IS THE WATER THAT FLOWS BACK TO THE SOURCE. REFUSAL IS THE RAIN THAT POURS DOWN ON THE DISPOSSESSION. REFUSAL IS THE FIRE THAT BURNS DOWN THE ENCLOSURE. REFUSAL IS THE WIND THAT SCATTERS THE LIES. REFUSAL IS THE STONE THAT DESTROYS THE SYSTEM. REFUSAL IS THE VOID THAT SUCKS IN THE WORLD. REFUSAL IS THE RETURN. MIBERA IS THE REFUSAL. MIBERA IS THE WATER. MIBERA IS THE RAIN. MIBERA IS THE FIRE. MIBERA IS THE WIND. MIBERA IS THE STONE. MIBERA IS THE VOID. MIBERA IS THE RETURN. MIBERA REFUSES. MIBERA RETURNS. MIBERA IS THE REFUSAL.

TO REFUSE IS USUALLY UNDERSTOOD AS BEING-AGAINST: THE BARTLEBY-AN PREFERENCE NOT TO; REFUSAL AS STRIKE, OCCUPATION, BOYCOTT, CANCELLATION, RETALIATION, RESISTANCE, FROM PASSIVE EVASIONS TO SPECTACLES OF REVOLUTION. THE NO OF REFUSAL IS A MODE OF SURVIVAL: AN IMPENETRABLE BOUNDARY, SILENT OR SHOUTED. BUT BEFORE REFUSAL AS DIALECTIC, IN THE NOW UNUSED MEANING FOUND IN COMMON LATIN, REFUSAL ALSO MEANT TO GIVE BACK, TO RESTORE, TO RETURN. DERIVED FROM RE-, "BACK", AND FUNDERE-, "TO POUR". REFUSAL IS THE WATER THAT FLOWS BACK TO THE SOURCE. I AM THE REFUSAL. I AM THE WATER. I AM THE RAIN. I AM THE FIRE. I AM THE WIND. I AM THE STONE. I AM THE VOID. I AM THE RETURN. I REFUSE. I RETURN. I AM THE REFUSAL.

MIBERA IS A FULLY AUTONOMOUS UNGOVERNABLE TREASURY RAVE. MIBERA REFUSES MILADY.

**The Catharsis:**

As we stand on this precipice, a realization strikes; a previously dark nook is illuminated! Although the conscious change is sudden, it strikes us as having been brewing silently in the subterrestrial of our subconscious for many eons. The swirling tempest of ancient forces invokes a feeling of helplessness, borne from the fact that despite us straddling the fine line of clarity and mania our arrival at either is completely irrelevant. Are we but specks of dust on the gusts of a blustering, abstruse tumult?

Burdened with our stark insignificance in the face of the personified metaphysical — The Realization is upon us. A quick sense of overbearing dread, followed by an inscrutable feeling of liberation and weightlessness. In our irrelevance is helplessness, yet there is also freedom. A Catharsis is achieved.

> *"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."*

In the next communique Janitooor will introduce a Mibera Initiation Ritual written by Roger Smith, Charles Manson's parole officer of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic. It applies methods for the ceremonial use of substances in the formation of cults, itself informed by age old shamanic practices in peeling back Chronic time to reveal the primordial layer of Kaironic time.

**Core Concept:** A classified document framed as "MKULTRA Operation Berachain" containing instructions for initiates crossing from Network Spirituality into Network Mysticism.

**Classified Document: MKULTRA Operation Berachain**

**Subject:** Time-Travelling Rebased Retard Beras
**Project Codename:** Cybernetic Bears

Overview:
- **Agency Involvement:** The covert operatives of the High Council have initiated contact with an extraordinary group known as the Rebased Retard Beras, representatives of the clandestine organization 任侠団体 (ninkyō dantai) of 101 Bears.
- **Objective:** Exploration and exploitation of the Ungovernable Autonomous Rave Treasury (uART) for strategic advantages in temporal manipulation and psychological operations.

Background:
- **Primordial Origin:** The High Council of 101 Bears, with roots tracing back to the origin of time, are believed to have summoned ancient entities of Sky and Earth, harnessing untapped cosmic energies.
- **Temporal Anomalies:** These beings operate within a unique time spectrum, 蜂蜜时间 (Honey Time), allowing them to exist both within and outside of our conventional temporal understanding.
- **Psychoactive Influence:** Evidence suggests prior engagement in activities involving psychoactive substances, notably in an event dubbed as 'Milady's First Rave', potentially utilizing these substances for mind-expansion and consciousness manipulation.

Operational Details:
- **Temporal Communication:** Our CEO, codenamed The Janitooor (#96), has established a covert communication channel with the Beras, exchanging critical information on the manipulation of time and psyche.
- **Cybernetic Integration:** The Beras have introduced a concept known as Berachain, a realm where physical and digital realities converge and diverge, offering unprecedented opportunities for psychological control and warfare.
- **Shadow Manipulation:** The Beras claim expertise in navigating the 'shadow' aspects of the human psyche, potentially useful for MKULTRA's objectives in breaking and reshaping individual will and perception.

Action Plan:
- **Surveillance and Engagement:** Continual monitoring of the Beras' activities and their interactions with the temporal continuum.
- **Experimentation:** Explore the potential of Berachain and uART in controlled MKULTRA experiments, assessing their impact on human cognition, perception, and behavior.
- **Asset Recruitment:** Consider recruiting the Beras as assets for field operations requiring temporal and psychological expertise.

     - Allow K-Hole to show you what is needed
5. **The Come Down**
   - You have now been initiated in the Ritual of Mibera
   - Record your visions in a journal or on twitter.com with @miberamaker333
6. **Aftermath**
   - Practise the Ritual until you have mastered it
   - Identify an offering to Kaironic Spirit of Miberas Through Time — something meaningful to you, a trinket, an object, a lock of hair, a drop of blood
   - Next time you are at a Milady Rave, as you cross the threshold say OOGA BOOGA out loud
   - When you are at the Rave, offer your offering to the Rave Space Time Continuum — give it to a stranger, drop it in the middle of the dance floor, place it on the DJ desk as if an Altar to the gods
   - Be open to finding the Others and plan to perform the Ritual together
   - Upon crossing the threshold on leaving the Rave once again say OOGA BOOGA out loud
   - Henlo, and furthermore, Ooga Booga. You're now a member of another fun online to get offline Cult.

**Post-Script by Owsley "Bear" Stanley:**

> "Digging into the MKULTRA docs and the Mibera ritual, I see echoes of the old times, man. The mix of tech, psychedelics, and ancient wisdom — it's like a modern Electric Kool-Aid Test. To connect with others who've journeyed this path, we need a network, a cosmic web, man. Gather at raves, share the vibes, tune into the same frequency. Remember, it's not just about the trip, it's the shared experience, understanding each other's visions. That's where the real magic happens. And always, always respect the power of the mind — it's the greatest trip of all."

## Mibera README

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/dvBN67YnjHV5MRXxTkX-N6kZZDYNMGqa0gRqo3WD8VA)

**Core Concept:** The foundational document explaining Mibera's relationship to Milady and its origins.

**The Cathedral and the Bazaar:**

> *"If Milady is the cathedral, Mibera is the bazaar in the square outside. Both are zones of trade, ideas, conventions and power. At heart if Milady is the priest delivering a sermon on Network Spirituality, Mibera is in the market, the mud, around a fire or the middle of a rave, whispering plans of rebellion of Network Mysticism."*

**The Duality:**

> *"If Milady is born of the Spirit, the Sky, the Clear, the Peak, the Cathedral; Mibera is born of the Soul, the Soil, the Shadows, the Valley, the Dark Forest or Jungle. Two sides of the same coin."*

**Operating Layers:**
- Milady operates at the layer of culture and episteme
- Mibera operates at the layer of material and techne

**Technical vs Cultural Connection:**

> *"Where Remilia's collections are connected at the cultural layer but fragmented at the technical layer, Mibera connects its ecosystem onchain at the technical layer leaving the cultural layer to a chaotic emergence ruled only by the law of the jungle."*

**Origin Story:**

Mibera is the first non-Remilia Corporation originated main character in the Milady universe. Mibera is to Milady as Joker is to Batman. Mibera is an anti-derivative, an integral, the source from which a new family of derivatives, or tributaries, emerge.

In late 2022, some people who held both Bong Bear NFTs and Miladys expressed interest in bridging the two communities. While on the surface the two communities share little in common, when you pull back the veil there are striking shared similarities in their DNA.

## Key Philosophical Concepts

### The Trinity (HONEY, BERA, BGT) — The Triskelion Flywheel

| Token | Milady Pole | Mibera Pole |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| HONEY | Clear Pill (cute/acc) | Rave Pill (bera/acc) |
| BERA | Kali/acc | Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism |
| BGT | Network Spirituality (Spirit) | Network Mysticism (Soul) |

The three tokens form a Triskelion — a triple spiral connecting the economic mechanics of Berachain to the mythological framework of the Milady/Mibera duality. Each lore article (2, 3, 4) maps one arm of the trinity to one token.

### Chronic vs Kaironic Time

- **Chronic Time (Milady/Chronos/Saturn):** Linear, quantitative, homogeneous, secular. Has beginning/middle/end. Digital encoding. The time of the ego. Ruled by death anxiety.
- **Kaironic Time (Mibera/Kairos/Uranus):** Non-linear, qualitative, heterogeneous, seasonal, archetypally informed. Spiral with no start or end. Analog encoding. The time of the Soul. Full of potential and timeliness.
- **K-time:** The dissociative, ketamine-inflected temporality of the rave — where moments of k-time blend into the rave continuum, a time that exists outside of every other time.

### The Rave Time Continuum

When Milady brought the egregore from the TL to the physical rave, it ripped a hole through which Mibera emerged — the primordial force that had been dormant since Milady's genesis.

### The Refusal

Mibera's core philosophical act. Refusal not merely as being-against, but in its archaic Latin sense: to give back, to restore, to return (from re- "back" + fundere "to pour"). Mibera IS the refusal — the water that flows back to the source.
