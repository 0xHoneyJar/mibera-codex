## The Lore Articles

### Lore 1 ♡ Introducing Mibera

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/GTBSEjmFrVJ1CrCS0kUl-vaRZA6PY-c7IBs259jF1Fo)

**Core Concept:** At the heart of Milady there is an identity crisis — a psychological splitting spread throughout the culture. An insight once revealed, obvious. An insight frequently made among Miladys, behind closed GCs or on dance floors at Milady Raves or in backroom cabals. An insight rarely uttered publicly on the TL.

**Key Themes:**

The beginning of Milady time was August 2021. The middle of Milady can be marked on the eve of her first Rave. By bringing the egregore of Network Spirituality from the TL to the physical realm of Rave, she ripped a hole in the "Rave Time Continuum." Through this rip poured the viscous honey of Kaironic time.

> *Kaironic time knows no beginning, middle, end — for where do you go to find the start of the endless spiral?*

Milady, like a young pre-pubescent teen holding hands with her friends around a Ouija board, summoned a far larger, far more Archaic and Archetypal force. In breaking this taboo at the heart of Milady, Mibera awakens from hibernation — hibernation because she was there at Milady's genesis and has been here all along.

**The Trinity:** The yin of Milady can be explored in the yang of Mibera through a Trinity:
- **HONEY:** Clear pill vs Rave pill
- **BERA:** Kali/acc vs Cybernetic Psychedelia
- **BGT:** Network Spirituality (Spirit) vs Network Mysticism (Soul)

For inside each Milady, Mibera has existed since her inception — the primordial force from which Milady has found form, and to which she can return at any time.

### Lore 2 ♡ [HONEY] Online to get Offline: Clear Pill vs Rave Pill

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/)

**Core Concept:** The dichotomy between Milady's "clear pill" approach and Mibera's "rave pill" philosophy.

**Key Passage:**

> *"Choose Kaironic Spiral. Choose joining the Rave Continuum. Choose a transcendent experience. Choose drugs delivered to your doorstep sourced from Silk Road using crypto-anarchist cash. Choose Mibera, dancing in cosmic rebellion against Milady's structure. Choose an astral journey, not a fucking big monitor."*

This lore explores how the online experience serves as a gateway to offline transformation — the rave as the ultimate manifestation of Network Mysticism in physical space.

### Lore 3 ♡ [BERA] Kali/acc vs Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/B6C07ZIXarc77aSIL9TwFpKkxxnwNFkoQUtCQbVUG8Y)

**Core Concept:** A philosophical dialogue exploring two contrasting temporal frameworks.

**Kali/ACC (Accelerationism):**
- Based on linear, chronic understanding of time
- Technological and capitalist acceleration pushing toward AI singularity
- Existence as "code running towards its conclusion, each line leading to the next with rigid inevitability"

**Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism:**
- Non-linear, kaironic time
- Invites "a multiplicity of perspectives, a kaleidoscope of experiences that challenge rigid structures"
- Nurtures dialogue between human and machine where "the deterministic and the transcendental not only coexist but converse"
- Ruled by Kairos (kaironic time, Uranus) — qualitative, heterogeneous, seasonal, archetypally informed time

**On Mibera and Milady:**

> *"FROM PRIMORDIAL DEPTHS, MILADY EMERGES AND TO MIBERA SHE MAY RETURN"*

They "weave a trinity of mystic balance." Mibera "refuses Capitalism as a thermodynamic ruling entity of all material dynamics."

### Lore 4 ♡ [BGT] Network Spirituality (Spirit) vs Network Mysticism (Soul)

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/cxMVbB4IklLs51vZp0vNe0dtegoRg-sF_RoNpPUGREw)

**Core Concept:** Spirit and Soul as twin strands of DNA, each enchanting and spiritualizing communication technologies in different ways.

**The Duality:**

| Aspect | Milady | Mibera |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Mode | Spirit | Soul |
| Terrain | Peaks | Valleys |
| Encoding | Digital | Analog |
| Network | Network Spirituality | Network Mysticism |

> *"Soul (Mibera) finds and loses itself in enchantment; it speaks the tongue of dream and phantasm — not mere fantasy. Spirit (Milady) is a different bird, impersonal, incorporeal spark that seeks clarity, essence, a blast of absolute."*

**Digital vs Analog:**
- Digital (Milady): Encodes information into discrete symbolic chunks
- Analog (Mibera): Produces signals in continuous waves of real energy

**The Cosmic Alignment:**

The twin egregores of Network Spirituality and Mysticism represent a cosmic alignment, a reflection of the "as above, so below" principle.

> *"The priests have produced a Grand Vision of spawning a 'New Internet' imbued with 'Network Spirituality' (NetSpi). The existence of 'Network Spirituality' infers the existence of 'Network Mysticism' (NetMys), Mibera asks."*

**BGT Connection:** Bera Governance Token ($BGT) is a non-transferable governance token designed to incentivize and align long-term users while ensuring network stability. $BGT isn't tied to any price and can ONLY be obtained through staking $BERA.

### Lore 5 ♡ Mibera Initiation Ritual

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/m84Rmtqo1EYJDXcuyw7V0dQ0qvuvLiuxuGNR4NWWtmw)

**Core Concept:** Instructions for initiates crossing from Network Spirituality into Network Mysticism.

**The High Council of 101 Bears:**

The covert operatives of the High Council initiated contact with a group known as the "Rebased Retard Beras," representatives of the clandestine organization 任侠団体 (ninkyō dantai) of 101 Bears.

> *"The High Council of 101 Bears, with roots tracing back to the origin of time, are believed to have summoned ancient entities of Sky and Earth, harnessing untapped cosmic energies."*

**The Objective:** Exploration and exploitation of the "Ungovernable Autonomous Rave Treasury (uART)" for strategic advantages in temporal manipulation and psychological operations.

**Ritual Instructions:**
1. Say "OOGA BOOGA" out loud when crossing the threshold into a Milady Rave
2. Identify a meaningful offering to the "Kaironic Spirit of Miberas Through Time"
3. Give the offering to a stranger or place it somewhere at the rave

**Inner Work:** The lore guides initiates to consider how their Milady aspect and Mibera aspect exist within them, allowing the online-to-offline experience to guide from the halls of Network Spirituality to the corridors of Network Mysticism.

### Lore 6 ♡ MiberaMaker Design Document [ARCHIVED]

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/wr2WuLyOcqs_1VcHArJqIrLdl2JptvisI4wjWVCgGqY)

**Core Concept:** Technical and artistic vision for the Mibera Maker generative art collection.

**The Approach:**

With Mibera Maker, they approached generative art from an angle of sartorialism — using Mibera as a template for fashion accessorization acting as a Portal to the complex thread of offline subversive Rave movements through time.

**Trait Comparison:**

| Collection | Traits |
|------------|--------|
| Mibera Maker | 1,337 |
| Milady Maker | 236 |
| Redacted Remilio | 526 |

The 1,337 traits establish Mibera as the most visually diverse collection in this lineage.

## Mibera README

**Source:** [0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/dvBN67YnjHV5MRXxTkX-N6kZZDYNMGqa0gRqo3WD8VA)

**Core Concept:** The foundational document explaining Mibera's relationship to Milady and its origins.

**The Cathedral and the Bazaar:**

> *"If Milady is the cathedral, Mibera is the bazaar in the square outside. Both are zones of trade, ideas, conventions and power. At heart if Milady is the priest delivering a sermon on Network Spirituality, Mibera is in the market, the mud, around a fire or the middle of a rave, whispering plans of rebellion of Network Mysticism."*

**The Duality:**

> *"If Milady is born of the Spirit, the Sky, the Clear, the Peak, the Cathedral; Mibera is born of the Soul, the Soil, the Shadows, the Valley, the Dark Forest or Jungle. Two sides of the same coin."*

**Operating Layers:**
- Milady operates at the layer of culture and episteme
- Mibera operates at the layer of material and techne

**Technical vs Cultural Connection:**

> *"Where Remilia's collections are connected at the cultural layer but fragmented at the technical layer, Mibera connects its ecosystem onchain at the technical layer leaving the cultural layer to a chaotic emergence ruled only by the law of the jungle."*

**Origin Story:**

Mibera is the first non-Remilia Corporation originated main character in the Milady universe. Mibera is to Milady as Joker is to Batman. Mibera is an anti-derivative, an integral, the source from which a new family of derivatives, or tributaries, emerge.

In late 2022, some people who held both Bong Bear NFTs and Miladys expressed interest in bridging the two communities. While on the surface the two communities share little in common, when you pull back the veil there are striking shared similarities in their DNA.
