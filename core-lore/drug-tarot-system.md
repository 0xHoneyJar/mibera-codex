# The Drug-Tarot System

*78 tarot cards mapped to 78 drugs — where ancient mysticism meets pharmacological reality.*

## Overview

The Mibera Drug-Tarot System is a core mystical framework that maps the 78 cards of the traditional tarot deck to 78 psychoactive substances. Each Mibera carries a drug trait that corresponds to a specific tarot card, linking their identity to both chemical and archetypal forces.

> *"Rave has taught us treasure can come from trash. Taking 'failed' 303s and giving birth to a new genre — a modern take on ancient tribal ritualistic ecstasy for the connection and proliferation of network connection."*

## Major Arcana

The 22 Major Arcana cards carry the most significant drug associations — powerful substances that represent major archetypal forces:

| Card | Drug | Type | Molecule | Symbolism |
|------|------|------|----------|-----------|
| The Devil | Methamphetamine | Modern | C10H15N | Bondage, addiction, abuse of power |
| The Moon | DMT | Both | C12H16N2 | Dreams, illusion, the unconscious |
| The Tower | Salvia Divinorum | Ancient | C23H28O8 | Sudden upheaval, breakthrough, destruction of ego |

| The Fool | Cannabis | Both | C21H30O2 | Beginnings, innocence, leap of faith |

> *"Kronos — the god of time, chronic time. Like the Grim Reaper with his sickle and scythe, he's the harbinger of death. The instrument of murder and castration. The old hunched man with the long beard. The one who shows up when your time has come."*

## Ancient ↔ Modern Pairings

Many drugs exist in pairs — an ancient plant medicine and its modern synthetic descendant or analog:

| Ancient | Modern | Connection |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Ephedra | Dextroamphetamine | Stimulant alkaloids |
| Ephedra | Methamphetamine | Stimulant alkaloids |
| Kwao Krua | Estrogen | Phytoestrogens |
| Psilocybin Mushrooms | Synthetic Psilocybin | Same molecule |
| Coca Leaf | Cocaine | Refined alkaloid |
| Opium Poppy | Morphine/Heroin | Refined alkaloids |

These pairings reflect the time-travelling nature of Miberas — carrying ancient wisdom into modern contexts.
