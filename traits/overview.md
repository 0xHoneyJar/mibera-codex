## Tribe-Specific Traits

Certain trait categories are strongly associated with specific Archetypes and factor into the Swag Score calculation:

| Tribe-Aligned Category | Scoring Impact |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Icon | High |
| Hat | High |
| Item | High |
| Shirt | High |
| Molecules Background | High |

A Mibera with multiple traits from the same Archetype achieves higher **coherence** and a better Swag Score.

---

## Trait Naming Convention

Traits follow a systematic naming pattern for programmatic identification:

```
<archetype>_<category>_<name>
```

**Examples:**
- `freetekno_hat_pilot_cap`
- `acidhouse_shirt_smiley_tee`
- `chicagodetroit_glasses_rayban`
- `milady_item_honey_jar`

This convention allows the scoring algorithm to automatically calculate tribal coherence.

---

## Trait Rarity

Traits are distributed across the 10,000 Mibera collection following a bell curve for Swag Score calculation:

- **Ultra Rare:** < 0.5% of collection
- **Rare:** 0.5% - 2%
- **Uncommon:** 2% - 10%
- **Common:** 10% - 25%
- **Very Common:** > 25%

Some trait categories (like special collaboration items) have fixed rarity assignments outside the bell curve.
