**Summary:** Tornado Cash is an open-source, non-custodial, decentralized cryptocurrency tumbler that operates on Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible networks. It enhances transaction privacy by mixing potentially identifiable cryptocurrency funds with others, obscuring the trail to the original source using zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs).
