**Summary:** $MOTHER is a Solana-based meme coin launched by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea on May 28, 2024, as a community-driven token focused on entertainment rather than traditional utility. It quickly gained traction, hitting a $186 million market cap shortly after launch, despite criticism (e.g., from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who called celebrity tokens like it "financial gimmicks"). Azalea has actively promoted it through memes, merchandise, and partnerships, including with DWF Labs (boosting its price 50% in July 2024) and a telecom co-founding effort allowing $MOTHER payments for phones and plans via Sphere Labs and Unreal Mobile.
