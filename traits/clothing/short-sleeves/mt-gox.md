**Summary:** Mt. Gox was the world's largest Bitcoin exchange (2010–2014) that collapsed after 850,000 BTC were stolen due to hacks and poor security. It filed for bankruptcy in 2014, shaking the crypto market. Creditors are still being repaid; as of Oct 2025, the deadline was extended to Oct 2026, with ~35,000 BTC left to distribute.
