**Summary:** "Bear Down" is the iconic rallying cry and slogan of the Chicago Bears NFL team, originating from their official fight song "Bear Down, Chicago Bears", written in 1941. The song was composed by Al Hoffman under the pseudonym Jerry Downs. Hoffman had no personal ties to Chicago or the Bears. It was inspired by the Bears' dominant 1940 NFL Championship win (73-0 over the Washington Redskins, still the largest margin in NFL history) during their "Monsters of the Midway" era, referencing their innovative T-formation offense. The phrase "bear down" is an old English idiom meaning to exert full effort or pressure (as in childbirth or intense focus), predating both the song and the team—it's a pun on the Bears' name.
