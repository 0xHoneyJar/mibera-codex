**Summary:** RAF's violent legacy (assassinations, kidnappings) symbolized anti-capitalist resistance. Berlin's techno scene emerged from abandoned spaces (e.g., bunkers, factories) tied to Cold War scars and RAF-era radicalism. Clubs like Tresor (opened 1991) embodied a "no future" ethos echoing RAF's nihilism, fostering a DIY, anti-authoritarian vibe. Techno raves were seen as modern "urban guerrilla" acts against conformity.
