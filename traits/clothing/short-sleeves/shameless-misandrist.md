**Summary:** The piece was made by Ollie Henderson mentioned in an article he wrote himself about it called heapsgay.com. The article argues that misandry (hatred of men) and misogyny (hatred of women) are not equivalents due to systemic power imbalances: misogyny reinforces women's oppression, while misandry is a powerless, reactive pushback lacking institutional harm.
