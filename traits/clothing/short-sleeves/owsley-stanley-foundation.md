**Summary:** The Owsley Stanley Foundation is a NGO founded to preserve and restore the "Bear’s Sonic Journals"—an archive of over 1,300 high-quality live concert soundboard recordings captured by Owsley "Bear" Stanley (1935–2011), the legendary Grateful Dead sound engineer, LSD chemist, and counterculture icon, from the 1960s to 1980s. Featuring artists like the Grateful Dead, Miles Davis, Johnny Cash, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Ali Akbar Khan, and the Allman Brothers Band, the foundation releases select recordings as audiophile albums to safeguard this musical history before the analog tapes degrade. Run by volunteers and funded by donations, it emphasizes sonic clarity and cultural legacy.
