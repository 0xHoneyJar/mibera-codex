**Summary:** Kasaya (or kāsāya) refers to the traditional dyed robes worn by Buddhist monks and nuns, symbolizing simplicity and detachment from materialism. Typically saffron, ochre, or maroon in color (depending on region and sect), the robes are made from patched cloth and consist of **three pieces:** an inner robe, outer robe, and mantle. The term derives from Sanskrit for "color" or "dyed," reflecting the original practice of using discarded rags boiled with natural dyes.
