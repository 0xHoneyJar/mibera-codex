**Summary:** Sari (or saree) is a traditional South Asian women's garment, consisting of a single unstitched strip of cloth, draped elegantly around the body over a petticoat and blouse. Worn primarily in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, it varies by region in fabric (cotton, silk, chiffon), draping style (e.g., Nivi, Bengali, Gujarati), and occasion. Dating back over 5,000 years, it symbolizes cultural identity and versatility.
