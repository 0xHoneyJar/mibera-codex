**Summary:** Microdosing psychedelics has ancient roots in indigenous cultures across Mesoamerica and South America, where low doses of psychedelic plants (such as: psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, morning glory seeds, etc) were used daily or ritually for therapeutic benefits like pain relief, courage, aphrodisiac effects, or treating ailments, alongside higher-dose ceremonies. The contemporary culture exploded around 2015 in Silicon Valley as a "productivity hack" among tech workers, influenced by 1960s counterculture (Steve Jobs and Bill Gates experimented with LSD) and high-pressure optimization trends (nootropics, biohacking, etc). Media coverage in Rolling Stone and Forbes framed it as enhancing creativity and performance, spreading globally via online communities (Reddit's r/microdosing).
