# Simple Green

**Visual Description:** A basic solid green t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Green

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Green carries stoner-culture associations and resonates with the natural/plant medicine thread that runs through Mibera's ethnobotanical lore.

**Color Symbolism:** Cannabis, nature, the forest rave. Green is the color of plant medicine traditions that span all twelve ancestor lineages — from khat to ayahuasca to cannabis. In rave culture, it's the color of the outdoor free party set in woodland clearings.

**Styling Notes:** Natural and grounded. Works well with wooden or organic-material accessories and items. Creates a coherent palette alongside the collection's many plant-derived items (bongs, joints, ayahuasca cups).

**Date Added:** August 2024
