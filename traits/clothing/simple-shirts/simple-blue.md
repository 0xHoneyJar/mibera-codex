**Visual Description:** A basic solid blue t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Blue

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Blue has resonance with Chicago Detroit's deep house and techno lineage — the blues tradition that birthed house music in Chicago and techno in Detroit.

**Color Symbolism:** The blues, night sky, deep water. Blue traces the musical genealogy from Mississippi Delta blues through Chicago electric blues to Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse — the unbroken line of Black American music that made rave culture possible. Also the color of dawn, the moment the party outlasts the night.

**Styling Notes:** Cool-toned and versatile. Pairs naturally with silver and chrome accessories. Can read as workwear (blue collar) or transcendent (sky, ocean) depending on context. Strong complement to warm-toned skin tones.

**Date Added:** August 2024
