**Visual Description:** A basic solid black t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Black

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Black is the default uniform of underground music culture across all four archetypes — from Freetekno squat raves to Chicago warehouse parties to Milady's post-internet aesthetic.

**Color Symbolism:** The underground, anonymity, the space between strobe flashes. Black is the color of the DJ booth, the unlit warehouse, the absence that makes the light show possible. In Milady context, it echoes the dark sophistication of network spirituality.

**Styling Notes:** The universal base layer. Black shirts recede visually, pushing all attention to the face, hair, and headwear. The highest-utility simple for any archetype pairing. Particularly strong with high-swag masks (MF Doom, Cypherpunk, Venetian) where the shirt should disappear.
