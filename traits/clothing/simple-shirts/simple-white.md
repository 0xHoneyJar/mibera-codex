# Simple White

**Visual Description:** A basic solid white t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** White

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). White pairs naturally with any tribe's accessories, making it the most versatile base. Frequently appears on high-swag Miberas where the hat, mask, or item carries the full visual weight.

**Color Symbolism:** Purity, blank slate, tabula rasa. In rave context, white catches UV light and fluoro paint — the shirt that glows under blacklights. Also resonates with the clinical aesthetics of ketamine culture and the sterile-turned-transcendent.

**Styling Notes:** Maximum contrast with dark accessories. Highlights face accessories (especially fluoro paint, Aboriginal markings, and blood splatter) by providing a clean backdrop. The go-to base for letting ancestor-aligned face paint speak.

**Date Added:** August 2024
