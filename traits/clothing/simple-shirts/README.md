# Simple Shirts

*Basic solid-colored shirts — the blank canvas beneath the chaos.*

## Overview

Simple shirts are solid-colored base garments without graphics or patterns. They serve as neutral foundations that don't affect archetype coherence, functioning as a visual reset that lets other traits — hats, face accessories, items — carry the tribal signal. In a collection dense with cultural references, the simple shirt is deliberate restraint.

Because simples carry no archetype tag, they are scored at 0X in the Swag Score calculation (same as mouth, friend, and eyebrow traits). They neither help nor hurt tribal coherence, making them the only clothing layer that is truly archetype-neutral.

### Design Philosophy

Simple shirts were painted in Gumi's characteristic impressionist style — solid fields of color rendered with visible brushwork rather than flat digital fills. Each shirt has subtle tonal variation and painterly texture, consistent with the collection's broader commitment to a hand-crafted, "smeary" aesthetic over clean digital precision.
