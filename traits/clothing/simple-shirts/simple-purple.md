**Visual Description:** A basic solid purple t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Purple

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Purple carries associations with psychedelia and altered consciousness across multiple archetypes — from Freetekno's DMT voyages to Acidhouse's synesthesia.

**Color Symbolism:** Psychedelia, mysticism, the visual field behind closed eyelids. Purple sits at the edge of visible light — the liminal color. In drug culture, it's the color of lean (codeine syrup), purple haze (Hendrix/cannabis), and the phosphene patterns of a DMT flash.

**Styling Notes:** A bold base that reads as countercultural without tribal specificity. Pairs well with gold accessories (earrings, chains) and lighter hair colors. Can read as regal or psychedelic depending on surrounding traits.

**Date Added:** August 2024
