**Visual Description:** A basic solid brown t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Brown

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Brown resonates with earth-connected aesthetics — the bear, the soil, the DIY traveller ethos of Freetekno, and the Berachain bear identity.

**Color Symbolism:** Earth, the bear, the land. Brown is the color of the Bera — the foundational identity layer of the entire Berachain ecosystem. It also connects to bushcraft, festival mud, and the raw materiality of free party culture where the land itself is the venue.

**Styling Notes:** Warm and grounded. Creates visual continuity with brown-toned bear masks, leather accessories, and Aboriginal earth-pigment face paint. The most "bera-coded" of the simple shirts.

**Date Added:** August 2024
