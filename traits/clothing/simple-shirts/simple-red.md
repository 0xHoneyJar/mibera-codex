**Visual Description:** A basic solid red t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Red

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Red carries energy and aggression that resonates across archetypes — from Freetekno's punk-influenced protest energy to Chicago Detroit's Marxist-informed social movements.

**Color Symbolism:** Blood, fire, revolution. Red is the color of the political — Rock Against Racism, the RAF, the raised fist. In rave culture, it's the laser cutting through fog, the exit sign you ignore to keep dancing, the bloodshot eyes at 6 AM. In Mibera's face accessory system, red dominates Aboriginal, Indian, Nepali, and Mononoke markings.

**Styling Notes:** High-energy base that commands attention. Best paired with minimal accessories to avoid visual overload, or with intentionally clashing elements for maximum punk energy. Creates strong visual anchoring for the Wartime blood-splatter face accessory.

**Date Added:** August 2024
