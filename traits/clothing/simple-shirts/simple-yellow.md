**Visual Description:** A basic solid yellow t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Yellow

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Yellow resonates with Acidhouse's smiley-face iconography and the Second Summer of Love's visual language, though it carries no scoring weight.

**Color Symbolism:** The acid smiley, euphoria, sunrise after an all-night set. Yellow is the color of the original 1988 smiley face that became the universal symbol of rave culture. Also echoes golden honey — the Berachain ecosystem's core resource.

**Styling Notes:** Warm and high-energy. Pairs well with darker accessories (black hats, dark glasses) for contrast. Works naturally alongside Acidhouse-coded items without formally belonging to the tribe.

**Date Added:** August 2024
