## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The vintage lace dress with floral embroidery references the Edwardian and Victorian-era feminine aesthetic that the Milady archetype channels — a deliberate callback to hyper-feminine dress codes, here reclaimed and recontextualized. The light blue-and-white palette also evokes the cottagecore and "old money" aesthetics that circulate in online fashion communities adjacent to the Milady scene.

**Era:** Victorian/Edwardian revival
