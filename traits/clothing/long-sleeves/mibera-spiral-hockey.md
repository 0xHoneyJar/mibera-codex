## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Mibera's own branded merchandise reimagined as sports apparel. The hockey jersey format was widely adopted by rave culture in the 1990s, where oversized athletic wear became standard dancefloor attire for its comfort and breathability. The 'spiral' in the name references Spiral Tribe, the legendary UK free party sound system whose nomadic, anarchic ethos is foundational to the freetekno archetype.

**Era:** Contemporary (Mibera original)
