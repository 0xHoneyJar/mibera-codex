## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Keith Haring (1958-1990) was an American artist whose bold, energetic line drawings emerged from the 1980s New York underground — the same downtown nightlife scene that birthed NYC house music. A regular at Club 57 and Paradise Garage, Haring's art was inseparable from the dance floor. His accessible, graffiti-rooted style broke the boundary between street art and gallery art, much as house music broke the boundary between underground and mainstream.

**Era:** 1980s

**Summary:** Keith Haring was an American artist and social activist who rose to fame in the 1980s New York art scene. He gained recognition for his bold, colorful subway chalk drawings featuring iconic motifs, simple yet energetic line-based symbols addressing themes of love, sex, birth, death, and social issues. He was also a vocal AIDS activist, creating works raising awareness about the epidemic, safe sex, and anti-discrimination.
