## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Kigurumi (着ぐるみ) are character-themed onesies originating from Japanese cosplay and Harajuku street fashion. Popular at anime conventions and in kawaii culture since the early 2000s, kigus became a fixture at raves and music festivals worldwide — where the playful, anonymizing full-body costume mirrors the masked, identity-dissolving experience of the dancefloor. The bear form directly references Berachain's bear motif. The 'Sun' variant with sparkly eyes evokes warmth and daylight energy.

**Era:** 2000s-present (Japanese street fashion)
