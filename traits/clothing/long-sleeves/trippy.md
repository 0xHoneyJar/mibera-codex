## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The all-over psychedelic pattern — swirling dots, curves, and organic shapes — draws from the visual language of acid art that has accompanied psychedelic culture since the 1960s. From Grateful Dead concert posters to 1990s psytrance flyer design, these fractal-like patterns mirror the visual distortions reported during psychedelic experiences. The dark colorway grounds it in the nocturnal end of the spectrum — more warehouse rave than Haight-Ashbury.

**Era:** 1960s-present (psychedelic visual tradition)
