## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Part of the kigurumi (着ぐるみ) series — character onesies from Japanese cosplay and Harajuku street fashion. The brown bear is the most classic and literal bear form in the set, directly evoking the Berachain bear identity. Kigus blur the line between costume and comfort wear, much as rave culture blurs the line between performance and participation.

**Era:** 2000s-present (Japanese street fashion)
