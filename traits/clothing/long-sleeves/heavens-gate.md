## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Heaven's Gate was an American UFO cult founded in the 1970s by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles. In March 1997, 39 members committed mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, California, believing a spacecraft trailing the Hale-Bopp comet would carry their souls to a higher plane. Members wore matching outfits — a uniformity reflected in this plain, cult-like garment. The group's blend of New Age spirituality, sci-fi mythology, and communal living places them in the same countercultural lineage that produced rave's own utopian communes.

**Era:** 1970s-1997

**Summary:** This 2017 Rolling Stone article marks the 20th anniversary of the Heaven's Gate cult's 1997 mass suicide, where 39 members died believing a UFO trailing the Hale-Bopp comet would take their souls to a higher level. **It highlights 10 lesser-known facts:** 1. Borrowed sci-fi imagery from Star Trek, Star Wars, and Close Encounters. 2. First gained attention with a 1975 UFO lecture in Oregon. 3. Members endured the Master Cleanse diet for extended periods. 4. Initially taught ascension to heaven without needing to die. 5. The suicides happened in staged waves over three days. 6. Strict uniformity rules applied to everything, including identical meals. 7. Believed the "Next Level" was genderless; several men (including leader) voluntarily castrated. 8. Final meal was a group dinner at Marie Callender’s restaurant. 9. Surviving ex-members still maintain the cult's original website. 10. Identical Nike Decade sneakers worn by victims were discontinued and became rare collectibles.
