## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Part of the kigurumi (着ぐるみ) series — character onesies from Japanese cosplay and Harajuku street fashion that became standard rave and festival wear for their playful anonymity. The polar bear variant's all-white palette stands out under UV light, connecting to the visual spectacle of the dancefloor. Bear form references Berachain's motif.

**Era:** 2000s-present (Japanese street fashion)
