## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The darker companion to the Light Blue Flowery — this navy lace dress with its prominent bow and floral detailing draws from the Gothic Lolita fashion subgenre that emerged in 1990s Harajuku, where Victorian silhouettes meet Japanese street style. The dark colorway produces an aesthetic of dark femininity that resonates with the Milady archetype's embrace of both elegance and edge.

**Era:** 1990s-present (Gothic Lolita / Harajuku)
