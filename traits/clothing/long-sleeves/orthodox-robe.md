## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The robe is a direct reference from a Youtube video that includes images of Orthodox Schema monks. Orthodox schema monks (or schemamonks) are advanced Eastern Orthodox monastics who have attained the highest rank, the Great Schema (Megaloschemos), after progressing through novice, lesser schema (Stavrophore), and other stages of monastic life. This tonsure signifies a profound spiritual commitment, involving stricter vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and seclusion for intense prayer, fasting, and asceticism to achieve union with God.
