## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Detroit Pistons-inspired basketball jersey references the 'Bad Boys' era (1988-1990), which ran parallel to the rise of Detroit techno. Both phenomena emerged from the same city at the same time — the Pistons' aggressive, blue-collar style mirroring the raw, industrial sound of Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. Basketball culture and electronic music shared venues, audiences, and attitude in late-1980s Detroit.

**Era:** 1980s
