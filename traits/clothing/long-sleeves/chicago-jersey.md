## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Chicago Bulls-inspired basketball jersey connects to the city's dual cultural identity in the late 1980s and 1990s — Michael Jordan's Bulls dynasty and the house music revolution were simultaneous phenomena, both rooted in Chicago's South Side and both defining the decade.
