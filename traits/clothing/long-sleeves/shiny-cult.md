## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The pristine white garment with its synthetic sheen evokes the uniformed aesthetics of new religious movements and utopian communes. In the freetekno context, the 'cult' label is reclaimed — free party sound systems like Spiral Tribe and Teknival collectives deliberately embraced cult-like communal living, nomadic existence, and shared identity. The shiny fabric nods to the synthetic materials of early rave fashion, where nylon and polyester caught UV light on the dancefloor.

**Era:** 1990s freetekno
