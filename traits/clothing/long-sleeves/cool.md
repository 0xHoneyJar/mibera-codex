## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The hand-drawn graphic style and patchwork aesthetic reflect the DIY zine and flyer culture central to underground music scenes — where photocopied art, hand-drawn logos, and crude illustrations became the visual language of rave from the late 1980s onward. The doodle-on-clothing look also connects to the Harajuku decora and punk-influenced street fashion that the Milady archetype draws from.

**Era:** 1980s-present
