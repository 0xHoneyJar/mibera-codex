## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The near-black suit is the most formal and austere of the Milady suit series. It evokes the uniform of finance, law, and corporate power — the antithesis of rave culture, worn here as ironic inversion. The suit-as-costume also references the Men in Black archetype and the anonymous corporate aesthetic of groups like Kraftwerk, who performed in matching suits to blur the line between human and machine.

**Era:** Cross-era (corporate satire)
