## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Henlo is a project within the Berachain ecosystem. The racing jacket format references motorsport-inspired fashion that has cycled through rave and streetwear culture since the 1990s — when Formula 1 and NASCAR sponsor jackets were adopted by the underground as ironic status symbols. The checkered flag pattern doubles as a visual nod to ska and two-tone culture.

**Era:** Contemporary (Berachain ecosystem)
