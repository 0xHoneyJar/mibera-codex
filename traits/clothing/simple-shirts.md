# Simple Shirts

*Basic solid-colored shirts — the blank canvas beneath the chaos.*

---

## Overview

Simple shirts are solid-colored base garments without graphics or patterns. They serve as neutral foundations that don't affect archetype coherence, functioning as a visual reset that lets other traits — hats, face accessories, items — carry the tribal signal. In a collection dense with cultural references, the simple shirt is deliberate restraint.

Because simples carry no archetype tag, they are scored at 0X in the Swag Score calculation (same as mouth, friend, and eyebrow traits). They neither help nor hurt tribal coherence, making them the only clothing layer that is truly archetype-neutral.

### Design Philosophy

Simple shirts were painted in Gumi's characteristic impressionist style — solid fields of color rendered with visible brushwork rather than flat digital fills. Each shirt has subtle tonal variation and painterly texture, consistent with the collection's broader commitment to a hand-crafted, "smeary" aesthetic over clean digital precision.

## Simple White

**Name:** Simple White

**Image Files:**
![Simple White](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/151_simple%20white.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid white t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** White

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). White pairs naturally with any tribe's accessories, making it the most versatile base. Frequently appears on high-swag Miberas where the hat, mask, or item carries the full visual weight.

**Color Symbolism:** Purity, blank slate, tabula rasa. In rave context, white catches UV light and fluoro paint — the shirt that glows under blacklights. Also resonates with the clinical aesthetics of ketamine culture and the sterile-turned-transcendent.

**Styling Notes:** Maximum contrast with dark accessories. Highlights face accessories (especially fluoro paint, Aboriginal markings, and blood splatter) by providing a clean backdrop. The go-to base for letting ancestor-aligned face paint speak.

## Simple Yellow

**Name:** Simple Yellow

**Image Files:**
![Simple Yellow](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/152_simple%20yellow.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid yellow t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Yellow

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Yellow resonates with Acidhouse's smiley-face iconography and the Second Summer of Love's visual language, though it carries no scoring weight.

**Color Symbolism:** The acid smiley, euphoria, sunrise after an all-night set. Yellow is the color of the original 1988 smiley face that became the universal symbol of rave culture. Also echoes golden honey — the Berachain ecosystem's core resource.

**Styling Notes:** Warm and high-energy. Pairs well with darker accessories (black hats, dark glasses) for contrast. Works naturally alongside Acidhouse-coded items without formally belonging to the tribe.

## Simple Black

**Name:** Simple Black

**Image Files:**
![Simple Black](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/145_simple%20black.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid black t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Black

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Black is the default uniform of underground music culture across all four archetypes — from Freetekno squat raves to Chicago warehouse parties to Milady's post-internet aesthetic.

**Color Symbolism:** The underground, anonymity, the space between strobe flashes. Black is the color of the DJ booth, the unlit warehouse, the absence that makes the light show possible. In Milady context, it echoes the dark sophistication of network spirituality.

**Styling Notes:** The universal base layer. Black shirts recede visually, pushing all attention to the face, hair, and headwear. The highest-utility simple for any archetype pairing. Particularly strong with high-swag masks (MF Doom, Cypherpunk, Venetian) where the shirt should disappear.

## Simple Purple

**Name:** Simple Purple

**Image Files:**
![Simple Purple](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/149_simple%20purple.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid purple t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Purple

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Purple carries associations with psychedelia and altered consciousness across multiple archetypes — from Freetekno's DMT voyages to Acidhouse's synesthesia.

**Color Symbolism:** Psychedelia, mysticism, the visual field behind closed eyelids. Purple sits at the edge of visible light — the liminal color. In drug culture, it's the color of lean (codeine syrup), purple haze (Hendrix/cannabis), and the phosphene patterns of a DMT flash.

**Styling Notes:** A bold base that reads as countercultural without tribal specificity. Pairs well with gold accessories (earrings, chains) and lighter hair colors. Can read as regal or psychedelic depending on surrounding traits.

## Simple Brown

**Name:** Simple Brown

**Image Files:**
![Simple Brown](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/147_simple%20brown.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid brown t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Brown

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Brown resonates with earth-connected aesthetics — the bear, the soil, the DIY traveller ethos of Freetekno, and the Berachain bear identity.

**Color Symbolism:** Earth, the bear, the land. Brown is the color of the Bera — the foundational identity layer of the entire Berachain ecosystem. It also connects to bushcraft, festival mud, and the raw materiality of free party culture where the land itself is the venue.

**Styling Notes:** Warm and grounded. Creates visual continuity with brown-toned bear masks, leather accessories, and Aboriginal earth-pigment face paint. The most "bera-coded" of the simple shirts.

## Simple Green

**Name:** Simple Green

**Image Files:**
![Simple Green](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/148_simple%20green.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid green t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Green

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Green carries stoner-culture associations and resonates with the natural/plant medicine thread that runs through Mibera's ethnobotanical lore.

**Color Symbolism:** Cannabis, nature, the forest rave. Green is the color of plant medicine traditions that span all twelve ancestor lineages — from khat to ayahuasca to cannabis. In rave culture, it's the color of the outdoor free party set in woodland clearings.

**Styling Notes:** Natural and grounded. Works well with wooden or organic-material accessories and items. Creates a coherent palette alongside the collection's many plant-derived items (bongs, joints, ayahuasca cups).

## Simple Blue

**Name:** Simple Blue

**Image Files:**
![Simple Blue](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/146_simple%20blue.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid blue t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Blue

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Blue has resonance with Chicago Detroit's deep house and techno lineage — the blues tradition that birthed house music in Chicago and techno in Detroit.

**Color Symbolism:** The blues, night sky, deep water. Blue traces the musical genealogy from Mississippi Delta blues through Chicago electric blues to Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse — the unbroken line of Black American music that made rave culture possible. Also the color of dawn, the moment the party outlasts the night.

**Styling Notes:** Cool-toned and versatile. Pairs naturally with silver and chrome accessories. Can read as workwear (blue collar) or transcendent (sky, ocean) depending on context. Strong complement to warm-toned skin tones.

## Simple Red

**Name:** Simple Red

**Image Files:**
![Simple Red](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/simple/simples%20for%20shadows/150_simple%20red.webp)

**Visual Description:** A basic solid red t-shirt.

**Dominant Colors:** Red

**Archetype Affinity:** None (archetype-neutral). Red carries energy and aggression that resonates across archetypes — from Freetekno's punk-influenced protest energy to Chicago Detroit's Marxist-informed social movements.

**Color Symbolism:** Blood, fire, revolution. Red is the color of the political — Rock Against Racism, the RAF, the raised fist. In rave culture, it's the laser cutting through fog, the exit sign you ignore to keep dancing, the bloodshot eyes at 6 AM. In Mibera's face accessory system, red dominates Aboriginal, Indian, Nepali, and Mononoke markings.

**Styling Notes:** High-energy base that commands attention. Best paired with minimal accessories to avoid visual overload, or with intentionally clashing elements for maximum punk energy. Creates strong visual anchoring for the Wartime blood-splatter face accessory.
