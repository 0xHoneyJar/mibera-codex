**Team Notes:** "Club Mate and other similar brands are made from roasted mate which tastes a lot different from mate drunk from gourds actually" — Puerhood, Jan 2024, #milady-week | "I was disappointed that similar-looking mate drink I saw in Brazil was nothing like club mate. It was super sweet and not sparkling" — Puerhood, Jan 2024, #milady-week
