## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** 

**Era:**


**Why This Matters:** The CCRU (Cybernetic Culture Research Unit) was a rogue academic collective at Warwick University in the 1990s that fused philosophy, electronic music, and occultism into a new form of theory-fiction. Its ideas about hyperstition and cultural engineering are woven into both Milady and Mibera's philosophical foundations.

**Team Notes:** "conceptually all we are doing here is introducing tensions... even with the callbacks to CCRU; one of the reasons it was the way it was is that it was a unit which had many competitive and contradicting philosophies which did not agree with each other - but there was an environment of healthy space for disagreement" — Jani, Aug 2023, #general | "which direction would be better for philosophy behind mibera wrt CCRU -- do we go for an alternate reading of nick lands acceleration relation to raves OR do we go for an alternate philosopher from CCRU with a different reading" — Jani, Aug 2023, #goldenlight
