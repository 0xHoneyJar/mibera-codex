# Singapore Jani 1

## Visual Properties

**Visual Description:** Custom-made mask worn by Jani (deepname99) at Token 2024 in Singapore. First of two unique founder masks from the event.

**Dominant Colors:** —

---

## Cultural Context

**Cultural Origin:** Token 2024, Singapore

**Era:** Modern

**Why This Matters:** One of only two masks in the entire 10,000 Mibera collection directly tied to the founder. Jani had two custom masks made for the Token conference in Singapore — both were subsequently stolen. The masks became an artifact of real-world loss woven into the generative collection. Both Singapore Jani masks landed on Rank D Miberas, compounding the bad luck that followed these pieces from Singapore.
