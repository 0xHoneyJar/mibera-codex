## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Moretta mask, is a traditional Venetian mask historically reserved for women, popular in 18th-century Venice. Made of black velvet and round in shape, also known as the "muta," it fully conceals the wearer’s face, symbolizing seduction and mystery. Held in place by a button bitten by the teeth, it silenced the wearer, adding to its enigmatic allure, and is showcased by Ca’ Macana as an authentic paper-mâché carnival mask.
