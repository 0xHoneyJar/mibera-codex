**Team Notes:** "Rethink location of all: face masks, eye masks. Cannot be same layer as glasses anymore. Different categories for eye and face masks maybe? Face masks need to be over mouths. Eye masks need to be below hair. Might be worth just getting rid of eye masks tho since there are very few." — Gumi, Jun 2024, #trait-updates
