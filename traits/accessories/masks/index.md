# Masks

*Face coverings from ritual to rave — anonymity as identity.*

## Overview

Masks are among the most visually transformative traits in the collection. They range from functional rave gear to cultural face coverings to political statements, and many replace the hair layer entirely (marked `[no hair]`), fundamentally altering the character's silhouette.

### Design Philosophy

Masks occupy a unique position in the layer system. During development, Gumi identified a critical architectural challenge: masks needed to render **over** mouths but **under** certain hair layers, creating conflicts with the glasses layer they originally shared. The solution was to separate face masks, eye masks, and glasses into different categories — a late-stage technical decision that improved visual fidelity across the collection.

Several masks carry the `[no hair]` tag, meaning they completely replace the hair layer. This was a deliberate artistic choice: masks like Bear Mask, Kim Jong Mask, and Hamas obscure so much of the face that hair becomes visually irrelevant. These maskless-hair combinations create the most dramatically different Miberas in the collection.
