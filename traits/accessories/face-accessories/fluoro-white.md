**Summary:** In the 90s, fluorescent colors were a key part of rave culture, symbolizing freedom and self-expression. Rave fashion, characterized by its bold and eclectic style, embraced fluorescent clothing and accessories like glow sticks, often under ultraviolet lights, to create a vibrant and energetic atmosphere. This aesthetic was a visual representation of the rave scene's spirit of liberation and individuality. Fluorescent accessories like glow sticks, bracelets, and even face and body paint were integral to the rave look.
