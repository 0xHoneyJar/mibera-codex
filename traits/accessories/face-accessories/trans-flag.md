## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The transgender movement's history traces back to ancient cultures, with examples like the Hijra in India and Two-Spirit individuals in Native American societies, recognized for gender diversity. Modern activism began in the 20th century, with pioneers like Magnus Hirschfeld in Germany (1890s) advocating for gender variance. Key milestones include Christine Jorgensen’s 1952 gender confirmation surgery, sparking public awareness, and the 1966 Compton’s Cafeteria riot in San Francisco, an early transgender uprising. The Stonewall Riots (1969) boosted the movement, led by trans figures like Marsha P. Johnson.
