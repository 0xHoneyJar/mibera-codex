**Summary:** Princess Mononoke, is a 1997 animated film by Hayao Miyazaki, follows Ashitaka, a young warrior, and San, a human raised by wolves, in a conflict between nature and industrialization in feudal Japan. San, known as Princess Mononoke, fights to protect the forest and its spirit, embodying a fierce, wild spirit torn between human and natural worlds. Her face paint, consisting of red stripes on her cheeks, is a key symbol. Made with natural pigments, it reflects her wolf upbringing and warrior identity, aligning her with the forest's primal forces. The red color signifies strength, blood, and life, contrasting with her human heritage, and marks her as a protector of nature.
