## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The origin of Aboriginal Australian red, black, and white face paint lies in ancient Indigenous cultural practices, dating back tens of thousands of years. These colors, derived from natural ochres (red and yellow from iron oxide, white from kaolin clay, black from charcoal or manganese), are used in ceremonies, storytelling, and rites of passage. Red symbolizes the earth, blood, and life; black represents the people and the night sky; and white signifies peace, spirit, or the ancestors. Applied in intricate patterns during corroborees or body painting, they connect individuals to the Dreamtime, their spiritual creation narrative.
