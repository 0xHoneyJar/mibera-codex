# Face Accessories

*The marks we carry — paint, blood, symbols, and scars.*

---

## Overview

Face accessories add cultural markers, spiritual symbols, and aesthetic effects directly to the face layer. They are among the most culturally loaded traits in the collection, connecting individual Miberas to specific ancestor lineages, real-world movements, and the lived texture of rave culture.

Face accessories sit at layer z60 — between the body and the hair front layer — meaning they are painted *onto* the skin and partially covered by hair. This layer position was a deliberate choice: face accessories are intimate, not worn on top but applied directly to the self.

### Design Philosophy

The face accessory set was primarily created by **Gumi**, with contributions from **Fedor** (Dots), **Sunbera** (all Fluoro variants), and **Jani** (Oil, Bindi, Red Forehead, Aboriginal markings, Hindu Swastika). Many carry ancestor-specific cultural research, making them the trait category with the deepest ethnographic documentation.

Face accessories carry a 0.5X multiplier in the Swag Score system — a light touch on scoring that acknowledges their cultural significance without making them dominant in the rarity calculation.
