## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Amanita genus is a group of mushrooms in the Agaricales order, known for distinctive features like a veil, white spore print, and often a bulbous stem base. It includes over 600 species, ranging from edible to highly toxic. Notable species include Amanita muscaria (fly agaric), with its iconic red cap and white warts, often toxic and hallucinogenic, and Amanita phalloides (death cap), responsible for most fatal mushroom poisonings due to its potent toxins. They typically grow in forests, forming mycorrhizal relationships with trees.

**Team Notes:** "I've been thinking of Slavs and drugs and it should mainly be mushrooms. There is one which was popularized in the 90s by a cult writer Viktor Pelevin (his books are quite psychedelic too). It's amanita. Would probably make a good hat." — Puerhood, Oct 2023, #ancestors
