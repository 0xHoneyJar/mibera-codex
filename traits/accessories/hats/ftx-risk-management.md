## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** FTX's risk management was a flawed system meant to oversee financial risks at the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which collapsed in 2022. It was supposed to monitor and mitigate risks like market volatility, liquidity issues, and improper use of customer funds. However, FTX, led by Sam Bankman-Fried, lacked a dedicated risk management team and had no effective controls, allowing the misappropriation of $8 billion in customer funds to its sister firm, Alameda Research, for speculative investments. This absence of oversight, combined with poor governance and no regulatory compliance, led to massive fraud and bankruptcy.
