## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Midsommar (2019), directed by Ari Aster, is a folk horror film following Dani, a grieving American student, who joins her boyfriend and his friends on a trip to a remote Swedish commune for a rare midsummer festival. As the group encounters the cult-like Hårga community, the seemingly idyllic rituals turn increasingly disturbing, blending psychological horror with vibrant, daylight-drenched visuals. The film explores themes of grief, trauma, and toxic relationships, culminating in the main character’s unsettling transformation.
