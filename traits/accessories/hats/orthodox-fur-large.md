## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups; like Neturei Karta and Satmar Hasidim, who oppose Zionism and the State of Israel on religious grounds. They view the establishment of Israel as an anti-messianic act, believing Jews are forbidden to return collectively to the Holy Land or establish sovereignty until divine redemption by the Messiah. This stems from a Midrash interpretation that Jews must wait passively for divine intervention rather than pursue human-driven political efforts like Zionism. These groups see Israel’s existence as a violation of Jewish law and anticipate its divine dissolution.
