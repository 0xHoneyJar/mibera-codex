## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Sámi are an Indigenous people of northern Europe, primarily in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia’s Kola Peninsula, with a population of about 80,000–100,000. Traditionally nomadic, they’ve historically relied on reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting, with a rich culture featuring unique languages (9–11 dialects), joik singing, and duodji crafts. Facing centuries of forced assimilation, including bans on their language and land dispossession, they’ve maintained their identity through activism since the 1970s, gaining cultural protections and political representation like the Sámi Parliaments.
