# Elements

*The four classical elements that govern Mibera's cosmology.*

---

## Overview

Each Mibera is assigned an element based on their birth coordinates. The globe is divided into four quadrants, each mapped to a classical element:

| Element | Quadrant | Latitude | Longitude |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Air | Northeast | ≥ 0 (North) | ≥ 0 (East) |
| Earth | Northwest | ≥ 0 (North) | < 0 (West) |
| Fire | Southeast | < 0 (South) | ≥ 0 (East) |
| Water | Southwest | < 0 (South) | < 0 (West) |
