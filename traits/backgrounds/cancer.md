## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Cancer, the fourth zodiac sign (June 22 - July 22), is a water sign ruled by the Moon. Symbolized by the Crab, it represents emotion, intuition, and nurturing. Cancers are known for their caring, empathetic, and protective nature, often deeply connected to family and home. Generally, they can be sensitive and moody but are loyal and intuitive, with a strong sense of security and tradition.


**Why This Matters:** Zodiac constellation background. Cancer — home, family, protection.
