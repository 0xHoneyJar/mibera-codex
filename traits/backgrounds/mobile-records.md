## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Charlie Ace, born Valdene Dixon in 1945, was a pivotal figure in Jamaican music, known for his work as a DJ, producer, and entrepreneur. His Swing-A-Ling Mobile Record Shack, a converted Morris van, brought reggae and dancehall records directly to Kingston's streets in the 1970s, becoming a cultural icon. It promoted new music and artists, featured in media like Jamaican tourist magazines and a Channel 4 documentary.


**Why This Matters:** One of the earliest examples of taking music directly to the streets — a proto-sound system on wheels. Jamaican sound system culture is the root ancestor of all rave sound systems.
