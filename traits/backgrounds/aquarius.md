## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Aquarius, the eleventh zodiac sign (January 20 - February 18), is an air sign ruled by Uranus. Symbolized by the Water Bearer, it represents innovation, independence, and humanitarianism. Aquarians are known for their progressive, intellectual, and unconventional nature, often valuing freedom and social causes. They can be eccentric yet aloof, with a strong focus on individuality and community betterment.


**Why This Matters:** Zodiac constellation backgrounds give each Mibera a celestial identity. Aquarius — the rebel and the visionary.
