## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Pisces, the twelfth zodiac sign (February 19 - March 20), is a water sign ruled by Neptune. Symbolized by two fish, it embodies intuition, empathy, and creativity. Pisceans are known for their compassionate, dreamy, and artistic nature, often deeply emotional and adaptable. They can be idealistic but sometimes escapist, with a strong connection to spirituality and imagination.


**Why This Matters:** Zodiac constellation background. Pisces — dreams, mysticism, dissolution of boundaries.
