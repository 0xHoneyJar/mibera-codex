## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Mississippi River; the second-longest river in North America, stretches about 2,340 miles (3,766 km) from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. It drains 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, forming a vast watershed.


**Why This Matters:** Traces the migration routes that carried blues, jazz, and gospel northward from the American South to Chicago — the musical DNA that evolved into house and techno.
