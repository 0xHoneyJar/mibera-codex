## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Irish dry stone walls are mortarless stone structures that define much of Ireland’s rural landscape, particularly in the west and south, with an estimated 400,000 km across the country. Dating back to the Neolithic period, these walls were built to clear rocky fields for farming and to create boundaries for livestock and crops.


**Why This Matters:** Connects Mibera to its Irish roots. Neolithic structures, built without mortar — some of the project's key creators draw inspiration from this landscape.
