## Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** Freetekno is one of Mibera's four founding archetypes -- representing free parties, teknivals, DIY sound systems, and the anarchist ethos of unlicensed raves. The anarchy symbol and stacked speaker system in this background are the visual language of the movement, from Spiral Tribe to the Czech teknival scene.
