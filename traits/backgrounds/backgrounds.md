**Dominant Colors:** Black, white.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** The night sky has always been the backdrop for outdoor raves and free parties -- dancing under the stars is a primal experience that connects the Freetekno tradition of open-air teknivals to something ancient and universal. For time-travelling Beras, the stars are also navigational markers across eras.

**Visual Description:** Grassfield and cloudy sky.

**Dominant Colors:** Blue, white, and green


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** Open fields under cloudy skies evoke the classic outdoor rave and free festival setting -- from Castlemorton Common to Czech teknivals, these pastoral landscapes are where the Freetekno tribe gathers away from the city to dance in nature.

**Dominant Colors:** Dark orange, black, dark teal.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** (will read more docs for a more accurate BG and history on this)


**Why This Matters:** Apdao represents the governance and community coordination layer of the Berachain ecosystem. Its abstract gradient reflects the project's ethos of decentralized decision-making, a value shared with the DIY, leaderless organizing principles of freetekno sound system culture.

**Visual Description:** Painting-like scenery of a waterfall seen from behind some bushes.

**Dominant Colors:** White, green.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Kaieteur Falls; a stunning single-drop waterfall, plunging 226 meters with a flow rate of 663 cubic meters per second. Surrounded by the Amazonian rainforest, it’s a biodiversity hotspot with unique species. Discovered in 1870, it’s a major tourist attraction, accessible by plane or trek.


**Why This Matters:** Kaieteur Falls sits deep in the Guyanese rainforest, a region historically connected to the El Dorado myth and South American shamanic plant traditions. Its untouched wilderness represents the kind of remote, hidden paradise that time-travelling Beras seek out -- places where nature's raw power mirrors the intensity of the rave.

### Visual Properties

**Name:** Fyre Festival

**Image Files:**

**Visual Description:** Top point-of-view of the ocean and a huge pool going across the frame. Almost-white sand and concrete, with a bunch of trees around too..

**Dominant Colors:** Turquoise blue, sandy white, leafy green..


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Fyre Festival; a failed luxury music festival planned for April 2017 in the Bahamas, promoted by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule. Marketed as a high-end event with luxury accommodations and celebrity performances, it collapsed due to mismanagement, leaving attendees stranded with inadequate food, shelter, and transportation. It became a notorious example of fraudulent event planning, leading to lawsuits and McFarland’s imprisonment.


**Why This Matters:** Fyre Festival is the ultimate cautionary tale of commercialized festival culture gone wrong -- the polar opposite of the DIY, self-reliant ethos of freetekno and underground raves. Its inclusion is both an ironic meme and a reminder of why the Mibera ethos favors authentic, community-built gatherings over manufactured luxury.

**Visual Description:** View of what looks like the front side of a building with a metallic gate, and a huge ‘FORD’ sign standing tall.

**Dominant Colors:** Grey, green, light-sky blue.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Abandoned Ford Factory


**Why This Matters:** Abandoned automotive factories in Detroit became the birthplaces of techno music, where the Belleville Three and their successors threw the earliest underground parties. The Ford factory specifically ties to Detroit's industrial decline, which freed up vast empty spaces that became cathedrals of sound for the Chicago Detroit tribe.

## El Dorado

### Visual Properties

**Name:** El Dorado

**Image Files:**
![El Dorado](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/background__z10/el%20dorado.webp)


**Visual Description:** Golden pyramid-like site in the background, red-brown stone building, warm orange sky, and green trees / bushes.

**Dominant Colors:** Yellow, green.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** El Dorado, meaning "the golden one" in Spanish, is a legendary city or kingdom of immense wealth, often associated with gold, sought by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. Originating from Muisca rituals in modern-day Colombia, where a chief covered in gold dust made offerings in Lake Guatavita, the myth grew into tales of a hidden city.


**Why This Matters:** El Dorado is the archetypal quest for a mythical golden paradise -- a perfect metaphor for Mibera's time-travelling Beras chasing legendary moments across history. The Muisca gold rituals also connect to the project's interest in ancient ceremonial practices that predate and parallel modern rave's communal ecstasy.

## Stonehenge

### Visual Properties

**Name:** Stonehenge

**Image Files:**
![Stonehenge](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/background__z10/Stonehenge.webp)


**Visual Description:** Painting-like view of the Stonehenge (basically stacked gigantic stones) on a fresh field of grass.

**Dominant Colors:** Blue, green, grey.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England, built between 3000 and 2000 BCE. It consists of a ring of massive standing stones, some weighing up to 25 tons, arranged in a circular pattern. Constructed in phases, it likely served as a ceremonial or religious site, possibly for burial rituals or astronomical observations, aligning with the solstices.


**Why This Matters:** Stonehenge was the site of the legendary free festivals of the 1970s-80s, culminating in the 1985 Battle of the Beanfield when police violently dispersed the Peace Convoy -- a foundational moment in freetekno history. The solstice gatherings there represent the ancient roots of communal celebration that rave culture inherits.

**Dominant Colors:** Orange, grey.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 80’s Manchester red brick factories & buildings.


**Why This Matters:** Abandoned factories and warehouses were the birthplaces of rave culture -- from Manchester’s Hacienda to Detroit’s underground venues, these industrial spaces became cathedrals of sound. The red brick factories of 1980s Manchester specifically evoke the Madchester scene and Factory Records, where acid house first exploded in the UK.

**Dominant Colors:** Red, hot-pink / magenta, blue, green, yellow.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** The Rave series captures the sensory overload of being inside a rave -- strobing lights, silhouetted crowds, and pure chromatic chaos. These backgrounds place a Mibera directly into the dancefloor experience that is the spiritual heart of every tribe, from Freetekno to Acidhouse.

**Dominant Colors:** 


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** The blinding white light breaking through the crowd captures the transcendent peak of a rave -- that moment when the music, the lights, and the collective energy converge into something almost spiritual. This is the core lived experience that Mibera exists to celebrate.

**Visual Description:** Abstract painterly style with solid black background and large bright blue spots dominated with white showing its brightness, a blood red stroke can be seen in the right corner.

**Dominant Colors:** Black, light blue, white.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** The raw, painterly abstraction of light cutting through darkness evokes the earliest illegal warehouse raves -- minimal production, maximum intensity. This is rave stripped to its essence: sound, light, and darkness, the primal ingredients that birthed an entire culture.

**Visual Description:** Dark tunnel with yellow-ish rock walls with carvings on them.

**Dominant Colors:** Yellow / golden brown, black.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Irish dry stone walls are mortarless stone structures that define much of Ireland’s rural landscape, particularly in the west and south, with an estimated 400,000 km across the country. Dating back to the Neolithic period, these walls were built to clear rocky fields for farming and to create boundaries for livestock and crops.


**Why This Matters:** Ireland's ancient dry stone walls connect Mibera to its Irish roots and the landscape where some of the project's key creators draw inspiration. These Neolithic structures, built without mortar, embody the same DIY, communal building ethos that drives both freetekno sound systems and decentralized crypto communities.

**Visual Description:** Very thick blue cable with thin yellow stripes on it cut / snapped into two, showing smaller wires poking out of them. The background setting is soft ocean-blue.

**Dominant Colors:** Blue


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** Undersea cables are the physical backbone of the internet -- the hidden infrastructure that makes global digital culture, crypto networks, and online communities like Berachain possible. A severed cable symbolizes both the fragility and the radical materiality of the "network spirituality" that Mibera explores.

**Visual Description:** Big red mountain of rock / sandstone in a smooth rounded shape, surrounded by dry grasses, with a clear blue sky with white clouds.

**Dominant Colors:** Reddish brown, blue


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Massive sandstone rock formation in the southern part of the Northern Territory, Australia. It's a sacred site for the Anangu, the Indigenous custodians. Its reddish-brown surface changes color with the sunlight, especially at sunrise and sunset.


**Why This Matters:** Uluru is one of the world's most powerful sacred sites, central to Aboriginal Dreamtime cosmology that stretches back tens of thousands of years. For Mibera, it represents the deepest layer of ancestral spiritual practice -- the kind of ancient, land-based consciousness that the project's ancestor/tribe system honors alongside its Australian geographic references.

---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** "Techno City" is the title of Cybotron's (Juan Atkins) landmark 1984 track, one of the earliest techno records ever made. This background places the Mibera directly in the urban landscape that gave birth to the Chicago Detroit archetype -- the city as machine, as rhythm, as future.

---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Mississippi River; the second-longest river in North America, stretches about 2,340 miles (3,766 km) from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. It drains 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, forming a vast watershed.


**Why This Matters:** The Mississippi River is the artery connecting the American South to Chicago and the Great Lakes region, tracing the migration routes that carried blues, jazz, and gospel northward -- the musical DNA that eventually evolved into house and techno. It is the geographic lifeline of the Chicago Detroit tribe's sonic ancestry.

**Dominant Colors:** Dark purple, light sandy brown, light teal, green


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** Freetekno is one of Mibera's four founding archetypes -- representing free parties, teknivals, DIY sound systems, and the anarchist ethos of unlicensed raves. The anarchy symbol and stacked speaker system in this background are the visual language of the movement, from Spiral Tribe to the Czech teknival scene.

**Dominant Colors:** Green, blue, grey


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** River Boyne is located in Eastern Ireland, notably as the site of the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.


**Why This Matters:** The River Boyne flows past Newgrange and the Boyne Valley's Neolithic monuments, connecting Mibera to Ireland's deep prehistoric spiritual landscape. This region's 5,000-year-old ceremonial sites parallel the project's interest in how ancient communal rituals prefigure the collective ecstasy of the rave.

**Visual Description:** Painterly abstract style of a bright red and orange gradient, with white horizontal smudgy band near top and subtle squiggly grid pattern that’s semi transparent.

**Dominant Colors:** Bright red, orange


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Native American Church (NAC) is a syncretic religious organization combining Indigenous spiritual practices with Christianity, primarily among Native American communities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Founded in the late 19th century, it emphasizes the sacramental use of peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus, in ceremonies to foster spiritual connection, healing, and community.


**Why This Matters:** Peyote is one of the oldest known psychedelic sacraments, used for millennia in Indigenous ceremony. It connects directly to the Acidhouse archetype's exploration of psychedelic consciousness and altered states, while also honoring the ancestral spiritual traditions that long predate modern drug culture.

**Visual Description:** Large deep blue area that looks like water that stretches across the frame in between a pavement road and a grassy park.

**Dominant Colors:** Muted dark navy blue


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Panama Canal is a 50-mile, man-made waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, pivotal for global trade. Completed in 1914 by the U.S. after Panama’s independence from Colombia, it uses a lock system to handle 14,000+ ships annually, carrying over 300 million tons of cargo.


**Why This Matters:** The Panama Canal is a monument to connecting two separate worlds -- much like Mibera bridges the physical and digital, the ancient and the futuristic. It also evokes the global flow of goods, culture, and substances that has always shaped counterculture and the underground economy.

**Cultural Origin:** Indigenous Australian art, one of the world's oldest art traditions, dates back over 40,000 years and includes rock paintings, carvings, sculptures, and contemporary forms like acrylic paintings. Rooted in cultural and spiritual storytelling, it often depicts Dreamtime narratives, using symbols and patterns unique to different regions.


**Why This Matters:** Cave art represents the oldest known form of human creative expression and communal storytelling, dating back over 40,000 years. For Mibera, it embodies the idea that the impulse to gather, create, and share transcendent experiences -- whether through Dreamtime paintings or rave culture -- is as old as humanity itself.

## Midas in Pactolus

**Image Files:**
![Midas in Pactolus](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/background__z10/midas%20in%20pactolus.webp)


**Visual Description:** Painterly scenery of a pond / lake with greenish water, surrounded by rocks and greeneries. An old man wearing all earthy-brown clothing can be seen scooping the water.

**Dominant Colors:** Black, muted brown, bright light yellow.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** King Midas, granted his wish to turn everything he touched to gold, found it a curse as he could neither eat nor drink. Bacchus instructed him to wash in the Pactolus River to reverse it. In Poussin’s painting, a humbled Midas stands behind a river god and putti, symbolizing the river’s source and Bacchus. Created after Poussin’s arrival in Rome, it was among the first artworks acquired by The Met in 1871.


**Why This Matters:** The Midas myth is a parable about the curse of turning everything to gold -- deeply resonant for a crypto-native project that understands both the allure and the trap of financialization. Midas washing away his golden touch in the river mirrors the Mibera ethos of valuing culture and experience over mere speculation.

**Dominant Colors:** Black, yellow, hues of muted purple


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Charlie Ace, born Valdene Dixon in 1945, was a pivotal figure in Jamaican music, known for his work as a DJ, producer, and entrepreneur. His Swing-A-Ling Mobile Record Shack, a converted Morris van, brought reggae and dancehall records directly to Kingston's streets in the 1970s, becoming a cultural icon. It promoted new music and artists, featured in media like Jamaican tourist magazines and a Channel 4 documentary.


**Why This Matters:** Charlie Ace's mobile record shack is one of the earliest examples of taking music directly to the streets -- a proto-sound system on wheels that prefigured the mobile rigs of freetekno culture. Jamaican sound system culture is the root ancestor of all rave sound systems, making this a foundational reference for the entire Mibera universe.

**Why This Matters:** The 24/7 convenience store is a universal waypoint of late-night rave culture -- the place you end up at 4am for water, snacks, and cigarettes between sets. It is a liminal space where the rave world meets mundane reality, a shared experience that every raver recognizes regardless of tribe or era.

---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Augustus Owsley Stanley III, known as "Bear," was a key figure in the 1960s counterculture, producing over a million doses of pure LSD, fueling the Summer of Love and events like the Monterey Pop Festival. As the Grateful Dead’s sound engineer and financial backer, he pioneered live stereo mixing and recorded their performances, preserving them in the “Dick’s Picks” series. He also designed the band’s iconic dancing bear logo. After serving prison time for LSD production, he crafted jewelry and lived off-grid in Australia until his death in a 2011 car accident at age 76


**Why This Matters:** Owsley "Bear" Stanley is the ultimate ancestor figure for Mibera -- a chemist nicknamed "Bear" who produced the purest LSD of the 1960s, bankrolled the Grateful Dead, and designed their iconic dancing bear logo. His story directly fuses the bear identity, drug culture, and music history that are the three pillars of the Mibera universe.

In front is a green table with an open book, some geometrical tools, and a dodecahedron model resting on top of a red book; a clear / transparent rhombicuboctahedron half-filled with water is hanging from the ceiling.

**Dominant Colors:** Black, gold, green.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Luca Pacioli, an Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar, is known as the "Father of Accounting" for publishing the first detailed description of double-entry bookkeeping in his 1494 work, Summa de Arithmetica. Born in Sansepolcro, Tuscany, he studied mathematics and worked as a tutor and university professor across Italy. Pacioli collaborated with Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, teaching him mathematics and co-authoring De Divina Proportione (1509), which explored the golden ratio.


**Why This Matters:** Pacioli's invention of double-entry bookkeeping created the foundational technology for modern finance -- the same system of ledgers that blockchain technology now decentralizes. His collaboration with Leonardo da Vinci on the golden ratio connects mathematical beauty to artistic creation, a synthesis that Mibera embodies by merging generative art with on-chain economics.

Its famous winter solstice light alignment shows that our ancestors were engineering transcendent communal experiences thousands of years before raves. The triple spiral carvings and mushrooms visible in the scene connect it to theories about entheogenic use in Neolithic ritual.

## Ophiuchus

![Ophiuchus](https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/components/Constellations/ophiuchus.webp)


**Visual Description:** Deep blue night sky with bright white 4-points-stars connected by thin white lines forming a constellation (Ophiuchus).Smaller stars in white dots are scattered in the background.

**Dominant Colors:** Deep blue, white.


---

### Context


**Cultural Origin:** Ophiuchus, sometimes called the 13th zodiac sign (November 29 - December 17), is not officially recognized in traditional Western astrology. Represented by a serpent-bearer, it’s linked to the constellation of the same name and associated with healing, wisdom, and transformation, inspired by the mythological figure Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. Those born under Ophiuchus are said to be intuitive, curious, and seekers of knowledge, though its inclusion in astrology remains debated and uncommon.


**Why This Matters:** Ophiuchus is the hidden 13th sign, rejected by mainstream astrology -- making it the perfect emblem for those who exist outside conventional systems. Its association with healing and transformation through serpent wisdom parallels the underground pharmacology and spiritual seeking that runs through all four Mibera archetypes.
