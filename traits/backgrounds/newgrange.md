## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Newgrange is a prehistoric monument in County Meath, Ireland. Constructed with large stones, some decorated with megalithic art, it reflects advanced Neolithic engineering and cultural significance.


**Why This Matters:** Newgrange is older than the Egyptian pyramids and Stonehenge, built around 3200 BCE. Its famous winter solstice light alignment shows that our ancestors were engineering transcendent communal experiences thousands of years before raves. The triple spiral carvings and mushrooms visible in the scene connect it to theories about entheogenic use in Neolithic ritual.
