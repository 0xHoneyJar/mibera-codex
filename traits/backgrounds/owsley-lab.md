## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Augustus Owsley Stanley III, known as "Bear," was a key figure in the 1960s counterculture, producing over a million doses of pure LSD, fueling the Summer of Love and events like the Monterey Pop Festival. As the Grateful Dead’s sound engineer and financial backer, he pioneered live stereo mixing and recorded their performances, preserving them in the “Dick’s Picks” series. He also designed the band’s iconic dancing bear logo. After serving prison time for LSD production, he crafted jewelry and lived off-grid in Australia until his death in a 2011 car accident at age 76


**Why This Matters:** Owsley "Bear" Stanley is the ultimate ancestor figure for Mibera -- a chemist nicknamed "Bear" who produced the purest LSD of the 1960s, bankrolled the Grateful Dead, and designed their iconic dancing bear logo. His story directly fuses the bear identity, drug culture, and music history that are the three pillars of the Mibera universe.
