## Context


**Cultural Origin:** El Dorado, meaning "the golden one" in Spanish, is a legendary city or kingdom of immense wealth, often associated with gold, sought by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. Originating from Muisca rituals in modern-day Colombia, where a chief covered in gold dust made offerings in Lake Guatavita, the myth grew into tales of a hidden city.


**Why This Matters:** The archetypal quest for a mythical golden paradise. The Muisca gold rituals connect to the project's interest in ancient ceremonial practices.
