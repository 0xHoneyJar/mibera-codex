## Context


**Cultural Origin:** King Midas, granted his wish to turn everything he touched to gold, found it a curse as he could neither eat nor drink. Bacchus instructed him to wash in the Pactolus River to reverse it. In Poussin’s painting, a humbled Midas stands behind a river god and putti, symbolizing the river’s source and Bacchus. Created after Poussin’s arrival in Rome, it was among the first artworks acquired by The Met in 1871.


**Why This Matters:** A parable about the curse of turning everything to gold — resonant for a crypto-native project. Based on the Poussin painting, one of the first artworks acquired by The Met in 1871.
