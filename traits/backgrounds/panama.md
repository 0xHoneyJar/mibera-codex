## Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Panama Canal is a 50-mile, man-made waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, pivotal for global trade. Completed in 1914 by the U.S. after Panama’s independence from Colombia, it uses a lock system to handle 14,000+ ships annually, carrying over 300 million tons of cargo.


**Why This Matters:** A monument to connecting two separate worlds. Evokes the global flow of goods, culture, and substances that shaped counterculture.
