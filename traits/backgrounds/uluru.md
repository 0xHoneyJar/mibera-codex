## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Massive sandstone rock formation in the southern part of the Northern Territory, Australia. It's a sacred site for the Anangu, the Indigenous custodians. Its reddish-brown surface changes color with the sunlight, especially at sunrise and sunset.


**Why This Matters:** Sacred site central to Aboriginal Dreamtime cosmology, stretching back tens of thousands of years. Ties to Mibera's Australian geographic references and ancestor system.
