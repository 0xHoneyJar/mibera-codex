## Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Native American Church (NAC) is a syncretic religious organization combining Indigenous spiritual practices with Christianity, primarily among Native American communities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Founded in the late 19th century, it emphasizes the sacramental use of peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus, in ceremonies to foster spiritual connection, healing, and community.


**Why This Matters:** One of the oldest known psychedelic sacraments, used for millennia in Indigenous ceremony. Acidhouse archetype.
