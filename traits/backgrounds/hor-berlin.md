## Context


**Cultural Origin:** HÖR Berlin, founded in 2019 by DJ duo TV.OUT in Berlin-Kreuzberg, is an independent online music platform and cultural space streaming DJ sets and live acts six days a week. Known for its distinctive bathroom-like studio, it gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, showcasing diverse electronic music from artists like Rødhåd, KI/KI, and Nina Kraviz. HÖR supports emerging and underrepresented artists, emphasizing inclusivity and experimental sound.


**Why This Matters:** Current generation of rave culture broadcasting itself — a DIY streaming platform born in a bathroom-tiled studio that became a global phenomenon.
