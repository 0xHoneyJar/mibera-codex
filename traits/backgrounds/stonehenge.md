## Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England, built between 3000 and 2000 BCE. It consists of a ring of massive standing stones, some weighing up to 25 tons, arranged in a circular pattern. Constructed in phases, it likely served as a ceremonial or religious site, possibly for burial rituals or astronomical observations, aligning with the solstices.


**Why This Matters:** Stonehenge was the site of the legendary free festivals of the 1970s-80s, culminating in the 1985 Battle of the Beanfield when police violently dispersed the Peace Convoy -- a foundational moment in freetekno history. The solstice gatherings there represent the ancient roots of communal celebration that rave culture inherits.
