## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Ophiuchus, sometimes called the 13th zodiac sign (November 29 - December 17), is not officially recognized in traditional Western astrology. Represented by a serpent-bearer, it’s linked to the constellation of the same name and associated with healing, wisdom, and transformation, inspired by the mythological figure Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. Those born under Ophiuchus are said to be intuitive, curious, and seekers of knowledge, though its inclusion in astrology remains debated and uncommon.


**Why This Matters:** The hidden 13th sign, rejected by mainstream astrology. Associated with healing and transformation through serpent wisdom.
