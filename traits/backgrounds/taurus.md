## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Taurus, the second zodiac sign (April 20 - May 20), is an earth sign ruled by Venus. Symbolized by the Bull, it represents stability, practicality, and sensuality. Taureans are known for their reliable, patient, and determined nature, often valuing comfort and beauty. Generally, they can be stubborn but are loyal, hardworking, and enjoy life’s pleasures.


**Why This Matters:** Zodiac constellation background. Taurus the Bull — special resonance within the Berachain ecosystem where bull and bear imagery defines the culture.
