## Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** ‘Twelve Apostles’, limestone stacks off the shore of Port Campbell National Park in Victoria, Australia, along the Great Ocean Road. Despite the name, there were never twelve stacks. They were originally nine, with seven remaining after collapses in 2005 and 2009.
