## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Fyre Festival; a failed luxury music festival planned for April 2017 in the Bahamas, promoted by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule. Marketed as a high-end event with luxury accommodations and celebrity performances, it collapsed due to mismanagement, leaving attendees stranded with inadequate food, shelter, and transportation. It became a notorious example of fraudulent event planning, leading to lawsuits and McFarland’s imprisonment.


**Why This Matters:** The polar opposite of DIY rave culture. Ironic meme reference.
