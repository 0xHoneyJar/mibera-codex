## Context


**Cultural Origin:** The Great Barrier Reef, off Australia's northeastern coast, is the world's largest coral reef system, spanning over 2,300 km with thousands of reefs and islands. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it supports immense biodiversity, including corals, fish, and marine life.


**Why This Matters:** One of Earth's largest living structures. Australian location ties to the project's recurring use of Australian sacred sites and landscapes.
