## Context


**Cultural Origin:** Luca Pacioli, an Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar, is known as the "Father of Accounting" for publishing the first detailed description of double-entry bookkeeping in his 1494 work, Summa de Arithmetica. Born in Sansepolcro, Tuscany, he studied mathematics and worked as a tutor and university professor across Italy. Pacioli collaborated with Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, teaching him mathematics and co-authoring De Divina Proportione (1509), which explored the golden ratio.


**Why This Matters:** Invented double-entry bookkeeping — the foundational ledger technology that blockchain now decentralizes. Collaborated with Leonardo da Vinci on the golden ratio.
