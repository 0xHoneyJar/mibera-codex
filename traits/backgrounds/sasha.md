## Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** Alexander "Sasha" Shulgin was the legendary psychedelic chemist who synthesized and personally tested over 200 psychoactive compounds, documenting them in PiHKAL and TiHKAL. His home laboratory is where MDMA was re-popularized for therapeutic and recreational use -- the very substance that fueled the acid house explosion and the entire rave movement.
