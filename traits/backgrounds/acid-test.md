## Context


**Cultural Origin:** 


**Why This Matters:** Ken Kesey's Acid Tests of 1965-66 were the original convergence of LSD, live music, and communal experience -- the direct ancestors of the rave. With the Grateful Dead providing the soundtrack and Owsley's acid fueling the experience, the Acid Tests invented the template that every rave, festival, and tekival has followed since.
