# Body

*Skin tones — the foundation layer of every Mibera.*

---

## Overview

Body traits define the base skin tone for each Mibera character. These form the foundation layer upon which all other traits are rendered. As the bottommost character element, body determines how every subsequent trait — face accessories, face paint, tattoos, clothing — visually interacts with the character.

The collection features 12 distinct skin tones, each painted with Gumi's characteristic impressionist brushwork. Rather than flat digital fills, each body tone has subtle color variation and texture, giving every Mibera a hand-painted quality even at the base layer.

### Design Philosophy

The skin tone palette was designed to represent the full spectrum of human appearance while maintaining the collection's painterly aesthetic. Each tone was named for natural materials — earth pigments, woods, metals, and organic substances — rather than clinical or reductive labels. This connects to Mibera's broader ethnobotanical and ancestral themes: the body is earth, and earth is the body.

Skin tones are archetype-neutral and do not affect Swag Score calculation. A Mibera's body is its canvas, not its tribal marker.

**Dominant Colors:** Cool white, porcelain

### Connections

**Ancestor:** The lightest tone in the collection. Porcelain-like quality connects to both East Asian ceramics traditions (Japanese ancestor lineage) and the pallor of post-rave exhaustion — the skin of someone who lives in warehouses and clubs rather than sunlight.

---

### Attribution

**Date Added:** August 13, 2024

**Introduced By:** Gumi

**Team Notes:** Cool-toned counterpart to Ivory. The lack of warm undertones gives Pale a distinctly different visual character under the collection's lighting.

---

### Attribution

**Date Added:** August 13, 2024

**Introduced By:** Gumi
