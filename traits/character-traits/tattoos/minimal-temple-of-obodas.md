**Summary:** a significant Nabataean city in the Negev Desert, flourishing from the 3rd century BCE to the 7th century CE. It was a key stop on the Incense Route after Petra, inhabited by Nabataeans, Romans, and Byzantines. Founded as a seasonal camp for Nabataean caravans, it featured structures like the Temple of Oboda, dedicated to the deified King Obodas I, and two Byzantine-era basilicas, including the Northern Basilica with inscriptions from the 6th–7th centuries CE.
