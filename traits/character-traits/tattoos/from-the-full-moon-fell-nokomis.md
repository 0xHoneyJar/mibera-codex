## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** "From the Full Moon Fell Nokomis" is a segment from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha (1855). It describes how Nokomis, a woman born from the moon, falls to earth after a rival cuts her grapevine swing out of jealousy. On the meadow, she gives birth to her daughter Wenonah. Despite Nokomis' warnings, Wenonah is seduced by the West Wind (Mudjekeewis), leading to the birth of Hiawatha. Wenonah dies in childbirth, and Nokomis raises Hiawatha, nurturing him with wisdom and care by the shores of Gitche Gumee (Lake Superior). The story highlights themes of ancestry, nature, and matriarchal influence.
