**Summary:** Tōshūsai Sharaku was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist active in 1794–1795, known for his vivid kabuki actor portraits. His bold, expressive style, with exaggerated features and dynamic poses, captured the essence of performers. Despite producing around 140 prints in a short period, his identity and life remain mysterious, with theories suggesting he was a Noh actor, samurai, or artist under a pseudonym. His work, initially underappreciated, later gained recognition for its psychological depth and artistic innovation. He vanished from the art scene as abruptly as he appeared, leaving a lasting legacy in ukiyo-e.
