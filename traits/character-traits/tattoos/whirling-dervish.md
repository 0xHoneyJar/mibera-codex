**Summary:** Sufi whirling, also known as "whirling dervishes," is a meditative dance practiced by Sufi Dervishes, primarily within the Mevlevi Order, founded in the 13th century by followers of the mystic poet Rumi in Konya, Turkey. Performers spin in circles to achieve spiritual ecstasy and connect with the divine, symbolizing the soul’s journey toward God and the cosmic order of planets orbiting the sun. Dancers wear traditional white robes with wide skirts (representing the ego’s shroud) and a black cloak (symbolizing the ego’s grave), which is shed during the dance. Accompanied by music like the ney (flute), the ritual involves specific movements, with the right hand raised to receive divine energy and the left lowered to transmit it to earth. Practiced mainly in Turkey and parts of the Middle East, it remains a profound expression of Sufi mysticism, emphasizing unity, love, and transcendence.
