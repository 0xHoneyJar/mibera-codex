**Summary:** A tughra is an ornate calligraphic monogram used by Ottoman sultans as a signature, symbolizing their authority. Originating in the 14th century, it features intricate Arabic script with the sultan’s name, title, and often their father’s name, stylized into a unique design. Tughras were used on official documents, coins, and seals, serving as a mark of legitimacy and sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire until its dissolution in 1922.
