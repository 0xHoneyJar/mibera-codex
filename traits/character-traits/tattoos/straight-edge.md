**Summary:** The article explores the evolution of the straight edge subculture, a hardcore punk movement originating in the early 1980s, centered on abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs. It highlights how the movement, named after Minor Threat’s 1981 song, has shifted from its militant roots to a more flexible identity in 2020. Core values—avoiding drugs, alcohol, and **smoking—remain, but attitudes vary:** some, like Nathan, treat it as a daily choice, while others, like Trevor of Eighteen Visions, view it as a lifelong commitment, expressing disappointment in those who “break edge.” The article notes a decline in the subculture’s early rigidity, with individuals like Jeremy (age 36) seeing it as second nature, open to possibly drinking later in life. Bands like Martha are still labeled straight edge despite some members no longer adhering, reflecting a less judgmental community. The piece underscores straight edge’s enduring relevance, balancing personal empowerment with evolving social acceptance.
