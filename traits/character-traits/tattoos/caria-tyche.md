**Summary:** Caria’s Tyche was associated with symbols such as the mural crown (representing city walls), cornucopia (abundance), and rudder (guiding fate). Her worship in Caria reflected the Hellenistic period’s emphasis on chance and fortune, especially after Alexander the Great’s conquests, when socio-political instability amplified her significance. In Caria, Tyche’s cult was part of a broader trend where cities personified their fortune through her, often depicting her on coins and in statues to invoke prosperity and protection.
