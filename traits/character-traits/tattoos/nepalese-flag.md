**Summary:** The Flag of Nepal, adopted in 1962 and formalized in the 2006 constitution, is the world’s only non-rectangular national flag, shaped like two stacked pennants. It features a crimson red background (symbolizing bravery and national flower, rhododendron), with a blue border (representing peace). The flag includes a white crescent moon with eight rays and a twelve-rayed sun, symbolizing hope, peace, and the Himalayan landscape. Its unique shape reflects Nepal’s cultural and historical identity, with roots in ancient traditions and Hindu-Buddhist symbolism. The flag’s design was simplified in 1962 from earlier, more complex versions.
