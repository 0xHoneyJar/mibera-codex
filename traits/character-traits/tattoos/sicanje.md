## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** Sicanje tattoo; a traditional tattooing practice among Catholic Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in the Rama region, believed to protect against forced marriages, abductions, or conversions to Islam. Performed mainly on girls aged 10-15, the tattoos were made off of a mixture of soot, honey, and milk, often on hands or chests.
