## Cultural Context


**Cultural Origin:** “Om” symbol (or Aum); a sacred sound and spiritual icon in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, representing the essence of the universe and the vibration of creation. Written as ॐ in Sanskrit, it combines the sounds "A," "U," and "M," symbolizing the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states, with silence afterward representing transcendence. Used in meditation, mantras, and rituals, it signifies unity, peace, and the connection to the divine, often depicted in art and tattoos for its spiritual depth.
