**Summary:** Sugar Skull is generally an iconic symbol of Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), a Mexican holiday celebrated on November 1-2 to honor deceased loved ones. Originating from ancient Meso-American traditions, sugar skulls (calaveras) were crafted from abundant sugar as a substitute for real skulls, a practice banned by Spanish colonizers who imposed Catholic rituals. Today, these colorful, decorated skulls symbolize the celebration of life and death, connecting modern Meso-Americans to their ancestors. In contemporary culture, sugar skulls are popular in tattoos, art, and decor, embraced globally for their vibrant, intricate designs.
