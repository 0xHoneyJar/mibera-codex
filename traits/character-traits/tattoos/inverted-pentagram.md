**Summary:** The meaning of the Inverted Pentagram varies according to the traditions and intentions in which it is used. In most interpretations, it symbolizes an inversion of spiritual values, a state where the Spirit is dominated by material or emotional forces. **It can be seen as a reflection of:** - an inner imbalance, - a loss of spiritual bearings, - or submission to primal instincts and drives. In this sense, it acts as a mirror of the state of the human being when he turns away from his higher nature. It symbolizes the human being who, instead of elevating himself, locks himself into the density of matter, in fear, ego or the will to power.
