# Eyebrows

*The micro-expressions that make a Mibera feel alive.*

---

## Overview

Eyebrows add emotional expression and personality to Mibera characters. In a collection built on minimalist, impressionist linework, eyebrows carry outsized emotional weight — two small strokes that determine whether a Mibera looks blissed out or battle-ready.

### Design Philosophy

Gumi designed the eyebrow set to cover a full emotional range within the collection's painterly constraints. Each eyebrow is rendered in solid black at layer z95 — near the top of the rendering stack, sitting above eyes and hair but below glasses and hats. This high z-position means eyebrows read as the final emotional "stamp" on the face before accessories are applied.

Eyebrows carry a 0X multiplier in the Swag Score system — they contribute to the character's personality but not its tribal coherence or rarity scoring. This makes them a purely expressive layer, free from the scoring pressures that shape other trait choices.

### Emotional Range

The 10 eyebrow styles map across an emotional spectrum:

| Eyebrow | Emotional State | Rave Context |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| [Concerned Thick](concerned-thick.md) | Worried, uneasy | Coming up, uncertain |
| [Intense](intense.md) | Focused, determined | Locked into the beat |
| [Anxious Thick](anxious-thick.md) | Nervous, alert | Pre-drop tension |
| [Concerned](concerned.md) | Lightly worried | Mild unease |
| [Short](short.md) | Alert, sharp | Quick-witted |
| [Normal](normal.md) | Neutral, calm | Baseline state |
| [Normal Thick](normal-thick.md) | Grounded, steady | Settled into the groove |
| [Anxious](anxious.md) | Tense, on edge | Stimulant energy |
| [Stern](stern.md) | Serious, rigid | Bouncer energy |
| [Raised](raised.md) | Surprised, skeptical | "What did I just take?" |

### Naming Convention

Eyebrow traits are named by combining expression and thickness where applicable: `{expression} {thickness}`

Examples: [`concerned thick`](concerned-thick.md), `anxious thick`, `normal thick`
