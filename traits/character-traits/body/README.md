# Body

*Skin tones — the foundation layer of every Mibera.*

---

## Overview

Body traits define the base skin tone for each Mibera character. These form the foundation layer upon which all other traits are rendered. As the bottommost character element, body determines how every subsequent trait — face accessories, face paint, tattoos, clothing — visually interacts with the character.

The collection features 12 distinct skin tones, each painted with Gumi's characteristic impressionist brushwork. Rather than flat digital fills, each body tone has subtle color variation and texture, giving every Mibera a hand-painted quality even at the base layer.

### Design Philosophy

The skin tone palette was designed to represent the full spectrum of human appearance while maintaining the collection's painterly aesthetic. Each tone was named for natural materials — earth pigments, woods, metals, and organic substances — rather than clinical or reductive labels.

Skin tones are archetype-neutral and do not affect Swag Score calculation.
