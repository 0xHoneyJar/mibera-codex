## Connections

**Ancestor:** The flushed quality evokes heightened states — exertion, embarrassment, or vasodilation from MDMA.

## Attribution

**Introduced By:** Gumi

**Team Notes:** The rosy undertone is a subtle but distinct departure from Pale and Ivory. Reads as "alive" in a way the cooler tones don't.
