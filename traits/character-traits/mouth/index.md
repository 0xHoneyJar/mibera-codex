# Mouth

*The smallest gesture that says the most — every Mibera's emotional signature.*

---

## Overview

Mouth traits convey emotion and altered state, from euphoric smiles to the unmistakable expressions of someone deep in a rave experience. In a collection where faces are rendered with minimal linework, the mouth is often just a single stroke or small shape — but that single stroke carries the emotional truth of the entire character.

### Design Philosophy

The mouth set was designed by Gumi (with queasy and toothpick by Fedor, and gurn by Jani) to capture the full arc of a night out — from anticipation through euphoria to the ragged edges of dawn. Several mouths include held objects (blunt, cigarette, toothpick, acid tab, heart) that transform the expression layer into an item layer, embedding drug culture and personality directly into the face.

Mouths carry a 0X multiplier in the Swag Score system — like eyebrows, they are purely expressive and don't influence tribal coherence. This frees the mouth to be the most honest trait on any Mibera.
