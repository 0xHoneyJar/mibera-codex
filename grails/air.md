## Visual Elements

Cloud-like figure in soft, diffused tones with no hard edges or weight. Unlike the other three element grails, which carry a distinct point of light in the chest, Air dissolves the light across the entire composition — sunlight filtering through atmosphere rather than shining from a single source.

## Why Mibera

Every Mibera is assigned one of four classical elements based on their birth coordinates. Air corresponds to the northeast quadrant (Europe, the Middle East, Asia) and the qualities of intellect, communication, movement, and breath. It's a textural signal — it doesn't define identity but colors how identity expresses.

The Air grail represents the element as its own identity rather than one layer in a Mibera's trait stack. All four element grails share a motif of sunlight as life-giving force, linking them as a set.
