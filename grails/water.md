## Visual Elements

Deep blues, teals, near-blacks. Everything flows downward — water obeys gravity and the composition follows. A point of light in the chest connects the figure to the sun. Water reflects and carries light rather than generating it.

## Why Mibera

Water corresponds to the southwest quadrant (South America, parts of Antarctica, the Atlantic) and the qualities of emotion, intuition, flow, dreams, and the unconscious. It's the most internal element — associated with what's below the surface.

The Water grail represents the element as its own identity rather than one layer in a Mibera's trait stack. All four element grails share a motif of sunlight as life-giving force, linking them as a set.
