## Visual Elements

The figure is mostly orange against a background that radiates from dark orange outward to lighter orange. Lines and movement push outward from the figure like heat rising off a surface. A point of light in the chest marks the source, connecting the figure to the sun.

## Why Mibera

Fire corresponds to the southeast quadrant (Australia, Indonesia, the Pacific Islands, parts of Asia and Africa) and the qualities of energy, passion, transformation, and willpower. It's the most active element — the one that changes everything it touches.

The Fire grail represents the element as its own identity rather than one layer in a Mibera's trait stack. All four element grails share a motif of sunlight as life-giving force, linking them as a set.
