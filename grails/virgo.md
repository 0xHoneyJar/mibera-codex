Persephone as Virgo. Holding pomegranate. Wheat sprigs in hair to signify both Demeter and the Virgo sheaf of grain. 141.27 planetary Hz of ruling planet Mercury reflected in flow of background pattern. Background inspired by Alex Grey's work. Nervous system focus represented on body, Mercury rules the nervous system. Green and gold, harvest and wealth. Neglecting red to showcase virginal purity.
