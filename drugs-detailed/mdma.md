# MDMA

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Euphoria, emotional warmth, empathy, increased sociability,
heightened sensory perception, and enhanced emotional connection.

**Natural Occurrence:** MDMA does not occur naturally.

## History

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) was first synthesized by Merck chemist Anton Kollisch in 1912 as an intermediate compound in a pharmaceutical patent, and its psychoactive effects went unrecognized for decades. Alexander Shulgin resynthesized it in 1976 and introduced it to psychotherapist Leo Zeff, who championed it as a therapeutic tool nicknamed "Adam" for its ability to return patients to a state of emotional openness. MDMA became synonymous with rave culture after fueling the Second Summer of Love in the UK in 1988-1989, and it remains the defining drug of electronic dance music culture worldwide, with ongoing clinical trials now advancing toward FDA-approved PTSD therapy.
