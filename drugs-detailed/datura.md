# Datura

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Vivid hallucinations, disorientation, visual distortions, and
amnesia. Datura is highly toxic, with risks including severe delirium, agitation, seizures, and
coma.

**Natural Occurrence:** Datura has been used in traditional
medicine and rituals for its sedative and hallucinogenic properties, particularly in Native
American and South Asian cultures. The weed grows worldwide in temperate and tropical
regions, often in disturbed soils.
**Appearance:** Woody-stalked, leafy herb
growing up to 2 meters. The plant has large, coarse, green leaves, trumpet-shaped white or
purple flowers, and spiky seed pods. Dried leaves or seeds appear as grayish-green to
brownish material, with a bitter, unpleasant odor.

## History

Datura species have been used in shamanic and ritual contexts for thousands of years across multiple continents, with archaeological evidence of Datura use in the American Southwest dating to at least 1000 BCE. It was sacred to both Aztec priests (as toloache) and Hindu devotees of Shiva in India, and it features prominently in European witchcraft traditions as an ingredient in "flying ointments." Datura's extreme unpredictability and toxicity have given it a fearsome reputation, and unlike most psychedelics, users rarely report positive experiences, leading to its characterization as a deliriant rather than a true hallucinogen.
