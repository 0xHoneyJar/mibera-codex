# Nicotine

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Stimulation / relaxation, short-term use may enhance memory and
attention. Addiction upon long-term usage.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to the Americas, tobacco has a long
history of use as a shamanic inebriant and stimulant. Nicotine is a naturally occurring stimulant
found in tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and other solanaceous plants. At room temperature, it is only
oily liquid. As a constituent of tobacco, it has been used for many centuries in the Americas and
Australia, and is now sold in a variety of common products worldwide.
**Appearance:** Annual or bi-annual growing
1-3 meters tall with large sticky leaves.

## History

Tobacco use by Indigenous peoples of the Americas dates back thousands of years, employed in sacred ceremonies, healing rituals, and social gatherings. European colonizers adopted the plant after Columbus's voyages in the late 15th century, and tobacco quickly became a global commodity and one of the most traded crops in history. The mass-produced cigarette emerged in the late 19th century, and by the 20th century nicotine addiction was recognized as a major public health crisis, leading to widespread regulation and anti-smoking campaigns.
