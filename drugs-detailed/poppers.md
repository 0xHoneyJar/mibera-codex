lightheadedness when inhaled. Enhances sensory perception, particularly tactile and sexual
sensations, and induces a brief sense of exhilaration. Effects onset within seconds and last
between 1-5 minutes.

**Natural Occurrence:** Poppers does not occur naturally, it is
synthesized from amyl alcohol and sodium nitrite in laboratory settings.

## History

Amyl nitrite was first synthesized by French chemist Antoine Balard in 1844, and its vasodilating properties were quickly applied to treating angina. By the 1960s and 1970s, poppers became widely adopted in gay club culture, particularly at discotheques and bathhouses, for their ability to enhance sensory experience and physical sensation. They became synonymous with the gay liberation movement and disco era, carried through into house music and rave culture of the 1980s-90s, and remain one of the most iconic substances associated with LGBTQ+ nightlife and dance culture.
