# Testosterone

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Promotes male secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair,
deep voice, muscle and bone growth, and libido. Testosterone can also enhance mood,
confidence, and aggression in some individuals. Side effects include acne, hair loss, increased
aggression, and mood swings.

**Natural Occurrence:** In humans and animals, it is synthesized
primarily in the testes for men and ovaries for women. In mammals, testosterone regulates
sexual differentiation, reproduction, and physical development. It also influences behavior such
as aggression and mating.
**Appearance:** Testosterone is not visible in
the body, existing in trace amounts in blood and tissues. It is extracted synthetically from
cholesterol or plant sterols.

## History

Testosterone was first isolated and synthesized in 1935 independently by Adolf Butenandt in Germany and Leopold Ruzicka in Switzerland, both of whom received the Nobel Prize for their work on sex hormones. Its anabolic properties were quickly exploited, with Soviet Olympic athletes using synthetic testosterone for performance enhancement by the 1950s, sparking the modern era of doping in sports. Testosterone replacement therapy became increasingly mainstream in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and the hormone has become a cultural symbol of masculinity, performance optimization, and the biohacking movement.
