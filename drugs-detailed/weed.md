# Weed

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Intoxicant, stimulant, psychedelic, depressant.

**Natural Occurrence:** Cannabis produces psychoactive
cannabinoid chemicals such as THC and CBD. It is the most widely used (still mostly) illegal
psychoactive and has a long history of medicinal, recreational, and industrial use. The fibrous
stalks of the plant are used to produce clothing and rope. Its legal status is rapidly changing in
the US and around the world from top contraband to tolerated mind-alterant alongside alcohol
and caffeine.
- Cannabis sativa is a tall plant, generally between 8-12 feet. The leaves have long thin
fingers and are light green. The more equatorial varieties have more yellow pigments to
protect the plant from intense light. Sativa buds are long and thin and turn red as they
mature in a warm environment. In cooler environments the buds may be slightly purple.

- Cannabis indica, is a short plant, generally between 3-6 feet and its leaves have short
broad fingers. The leaves are generally dark green, sometimes tinged with purple. As
they near maturity the leaves may become significantly more purple.

- Cannabis ruderalis features large seeds, short weedy plants between 4-6 feet tall and a
lower level of THC than sativas or indicas.

## History

Cannabis has been cultivated for at least 5,000 years, with early evidence of psychoactive use in Central Asia and ancient China, where it appeared in the pharmacopoeia of Emperor Shen Nung around 2737 BCE. It spread through India, the Middle East, and Africa before arriving in the Americas via colonial trade routes. Cannabis became a symbol of Rastafarian spirituality in Jamaica from the 1930s onward, fueled the hippie counterculture of the 1960s, and remains one of the most widely used psychoactive substances globally, with legalization accelerating in the 21st century.
