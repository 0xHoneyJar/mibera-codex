Tobacco has been cultivated and used by Indigenous peoples of the Americas for at least 8,000 years, serving as one of the most sacred plants in Native American spiritual practice, used for prayer, offerings, and ceremonial pipes. After Columbus brought tobacco to Europe in the late 15th century, it spread globally with extraordinary speed, becoming a major colonial cash crop that shaped the economies of Virginia, the Caribbean, and beyond. In India, tobacco was adopted into cultural practices including bidi smoking and hookah use, and by the 20th century, tobacco-related diseases were recognized as the leading preventable cause of death worldwide.
