# THC Edibles

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Intoxicant, stimulant, psychedelic, depressant.

**Natural Occurrence:** Cannabis produces psychoactive
cannabinoid chemicals such as THC and CBD. It is the most widely used (still mostly) illegal
psychoactive and has a long history of medicinal, recreational, and industrial use. The fibrous
stalks of the plant are used to produce clothing and rope. Its legal status is rapidly changing in
the US and around the world from top contraband to tolerated mind-alterant alongside alcohol
and caffeine.
- Cannabis sativa is a tall plant, generally between 8-12 feet. The leaves have long thin
fingers and are light green. The more equatorial varieties have more yellow pigments to
protect the plant from intense light. Sativa buds are long and thin and turn red as they
mature in a warm environment. In cooler environments the buds may be slightly purple.

- Cannabis indica, is a short plant, generally between 3-6 feet and its leaves have short
broad fingers. The leaves are generally dark green, sometimes tinged with purple. As
they near maturity the leaves may become significantly more purple.

- Cannabis ruderalis features large seeds, short weedy plants between 4-6 feet tall and a
lower level of THC than sativas or indicas.

## History

Cannabis-infused edibles have ancient roots, with the earliest known preparation being the Indian drink bhang, documented in Vedic texts around 1000 BCE and still consumed today during the Hindu festival of Holi. Hashish-based confections (majoun) were popular across the Arab world and were brought to Western literary attention by the Club des Hashischins in 1840s Paris, attended by writers like Baudelaire and Dumas. The modern THC edible market exploded with cannabis legalization in US states beginning with Colorado and Washington in 2012, creating a multibillion-dollar industry of precisely dosed gummies, chocolates, and beverages.
