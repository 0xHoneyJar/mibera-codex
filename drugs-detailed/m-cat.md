# M-Cat

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** M-Cat / Mephedrone acts as a central nervous system stimulant
by increasing levels of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the brain through reuptake
inhibition and release. It invokes euphoria, increased energy and sociability, and heightened
alertness. However, it can also cause adverse effects such as anxiety, paranoia, rapid heart
rate, sweating, and in high doses can lead to seizures or cardiovascular issues.

**Natural Occurrence:** M-cat does not occur in nature.

## History

Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) was first synthesized in 1929 by the French pharmacologist Saem de Burnaga Sanchez, but remained obscure until it was rediscovered and sold online as a "legal high" and "plant food" beginning around 2007. It exploded in popularity across the UK club and rave scene in 2009-2010, becoming briefly more popular than cocaine in some nightlife contexts. The UK banned mephedrone in April 2010 as a Class B drug, followed by similar bans across the EU, though it remains widely available on the black market.
