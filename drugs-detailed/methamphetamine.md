## History

Methamphetamine was first synthesized by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi in 1893 from ephedrine, and a more potent crystallized form was developed by Akira Ogata in 1919. It was widely distributed during World War II to soldiers on all sides under brand names like Pervitin (Germany) and Philopon (Japan) to combat fatigue and boost aggression. Post-war methamphetamine abuse became epidemic in Japan and later in the United States, where it fueled the biker and crank cultures of the 1960s-80s before the crystal meth epidemic devastated rural communities in the 1990s and 2000s.
