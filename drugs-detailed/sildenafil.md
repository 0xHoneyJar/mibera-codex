# Sildenafil

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Increased cGMP levels, smooth muscle relaxation, enhanced
bloodflow. In ED, it facilitates penile erection by improving blood flow in response to sexual
stimulation. In PAH, it reduces pulmonary artery pressure by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs.

**Natural Occurrence:** Sildenafil does not occur naturally. It was
developed by Pfizer through chemical synthesis.

## History

Sildenafil was originally developed by Pfizer scientists Andrew Bell, David Brown, and Nicholas Terrett in the UK during the late 1980s as a treatment for hypertension and angina. During clinical trials, researchers noticed a remarkable side effect of sustained penile erections, leading to its repurposing. Marketed as Viagra and approved by the FDA in March 1998, it became one of the fastest-selling pharmaceutical products in history and fundamentally changed the treatment of erectile dysfunction worldwide.
