# CBD

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Intoxicant, stimulant, psychedelic, depressant.

**Natural Occurrence:** Cannabis produces psychoactive
cannabinoid chemicals such as THC and CBD. It is the most widely used (still mostly) illegal
psychoactive and has a long history of medicinal, recreational, and industrial use. The fibrous
stalks of the plant are used to produce clothing and rope. Its legal status is rapidly changing in
the US and around the world from top contraband to tolerated mind-alterant alongside alcohol
and caffeine.
- Cannabis sativa is a tall plant, generally between 8-12 feet. The leaves have long thin
fingers and are light green. The more equatorial varieties have more yellow pigments to
protect the plant from intense light. Sativa buds are long and thin and turn red as they
mature in a warm environment. In cooler environments the buds may be slightly purple.

- Cannabis indica, is a short plant, generally between 3-6 feet and its leaves have short
broad fingers. The leaves are generally dark green, sometimes tinged with purple. As
they near maturity the leaves may become significantly more purple.

- Cannabis ruderalis features large seeds, short weedy plants between 4-6 feet tall and a
lower level of THC than sativas or indicas.

## History

Cannabidiol (CBD) was first isolated from cannabis by American chemist Roger Adams in 1940, but its chemical structure was not fully elucidated until 1963 by Raphael Mechoulam and Yechiel Shvo in Israel. For decades CBD was overshadowed by THC research, but it gained dramatic public attention in 2013 when CNN aired the story of Charlotte Figi, a child with severe epilepsy whose seizures were dramatically reduced by a CBD-rich cannabis extract (later named "Charlotte's Web"). The 2018 US Farm Bill legalized hemp-derived CBD, triggering a massive consumer market and CBD's integration into wellness, beauty, and even rave recovery culture.
