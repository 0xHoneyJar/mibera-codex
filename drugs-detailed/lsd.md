# LSD

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Altered perceptions, vivid hallucinations, and heightened
emotional states. Often accompanied by changes in thought patterns and a distorted sense of
time.

**Natural Occurrence:** LSD doesn’t occur in nature, it is best
known and most researched psychedelic. It is the standard against which all other psychedelics
are compared. It is active at extremely low doses and is most commonly available on blotter or
in liquid form.

## History

Albert Hofmann first synthesized LSD at Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland in 1938, and accidentally discovered its psychoactive effects in 1943 during the famous "Bicycle Day" (April 19). It became central to 1960s counterculture through Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, before being banned in the US in 1968. LSD resurfaced in the late 1980s acid house movement and remains foundational to psychedelic rave culture.
