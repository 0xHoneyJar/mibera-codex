# 2C-B

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Depending on the dose, the drug can induce altered perceptions,
vivid visual hallucinations, heightened emotional states, changes in thought patterns and a mild
distortion of time. It can also cause euphoria, increased sociability and introspective or
dissociative experiences.

**Natural Occurrence:** 2C-B does not occur in nature, it is a
synthetic compound created through chemical synthesis, derived from phenylethylamine
precursors with bromine and methoxy groups added to the aromatic ring.

## History

2C-B was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 and documented in his landmark book PiHKAL (1991), where he described it as one of his most important creations. It was briefly sold legally in the US as a therapeutic aid and aphrodisiac under the name "Nexus" before being classified as a Schedule I substance in 1995. 2C-B became a popular club and rave drug in Europe and South America from the late 1990s onward, valued for its unique blend of mild psychedelic visuals and empathogenic warmth at moderate doses.
