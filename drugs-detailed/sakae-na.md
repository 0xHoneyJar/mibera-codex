# Sakae Na

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Mild to moderate stimulation, increased alertness, focus, and
sociability, often compared to a caffeine-like “rush”.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to Southeast Asia (Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand), the tree grows in wet, open areas like riverbanks.
Traditionally, Sakae Naa leaves are chewed fresh or dried, brewed as tea, or smoked for energy
and pain relief, particularly in Thailand and Myanmar where it serves as a kratom substitute due
to the kratom ban.
**Appearance:** The tree grows up to 10
meters tall, has elliptic or obovate green leaves, yellowish-white flowers, and brownish-red
four-angled seeds. Dried leaves are greenish-brown to brown and often ground into brown
powder.

## History

Sakae Naa (Combretum quadrangulare) has been used in traditional medicine throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, for centuries as a treatment for fever, intestinal parasites, and general fatigue. It gained particular significance in Thailand after kratom was banned in 1943, as local communities turned to Sakae Naa leaves as a legal substitute for their mildly stimulant and pain-relieving effects. The plant remains relatively obscure outside Southeast Asia but has attracted growing international interest from the late 2010s onward among kratom users seeking legal alternatives.
