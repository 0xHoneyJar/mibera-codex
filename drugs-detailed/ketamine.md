# Ketamine

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Dissociation, mild hallucination, dream-like states.

**Natural Occurrence:** Ketamine doesn’t occur in nature, it was
first synthesized in 1962 by Parke-Davis.

## History

Ketamine was first synthesized in 1962 by Calvin Stevens at Parke-Davis Laboratories in Michigan as a safer alternative to the anesthetic PCP, and it was approved for medical use in 1970. It was widely used as a battlefield anesthetic during the Vietnam War due to its safety profile and ease of administration. Ketamine entered recreational and club culture in the 1980s-90s, becoming a staple of the UK rave scene and global dance music culture, valued for its dissociative "k-hole" experiences, and has recently undergone a remarkable clinical renaissance as a rapid-acting treatment for treatment-resistant depression.
