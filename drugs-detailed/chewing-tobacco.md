## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Stimulation / relaxation, short-term use may enhance memory and
attention. Addiction upon long-term usage.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to the Americas, tobacco has a long
history of use as a shamanic inebriant and stimulant. Nicotine is a naturally occurring stimulant
found in tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and other solanaceous plants. At room temperature, it is only
oily liquid. As a constituent of tobacco, it has been used for many centuries in the Americas and
Australia, and is now sold in a variety of common products worldwide.
**Appearance:** Annual or bi-annual growing
1-3 meters tall with large sticky leaves.

## History

Chewing tobacco has been used by Indigenous peoples of the Americas for thousands of years, with evidence of tobacco chewing among ancient Maya and North American tribes who combined it with lime or ash to enhance nicotine absorption. European colonists adopted the practice in the 16th and 17th centuries, and chewing tobacco became especially popular in rural America. In India, traditions of chewing tobacco mixed with betel leaf (paan) and areca nut date back centuries and remain deeply embedded in cultural practice, despite growing awareness of oral cancer risks.
