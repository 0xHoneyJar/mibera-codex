# Ibogaine

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Ibogaine induces intense, long-lasting hallucinations, often
described as dream-like or introspective visions. Physically it can increase heart rate and blood
pressure, and may invoke nausea, vomiting, and tremors. Ibogaine is highly toxic at high dose
with risks including cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.

**Natural Occurrence:** Found primarily in the root bark of
Tabernanthe iboga, the plant grows in tropical rainforest and is harvested for its psychoactive
and medicinal properties.
**Appearance:** Tabernanthe iboga has dark
green leaves, yellow, or white flowers, and brownish root bark. The root bark, when dried,
appears as reddish-brown to dark brown fibrous material, often ground into powder for
consumption.

## History

Ibogaine was first isolated from Tabernanthe iboga root bark by French chemists Dybowsky and Landrin in 1901, following reports from French colonists in Gabon about the powerful psychoactive properties of the Bwiti religious sacrament. The Bwiti tradition, practiced by the Fang and Mitsogo peoples of Central Africa, uses iboga root bark in initiation rituals that can last several days and involve intense visionary experiences. In 1962, American heroin addict Howard Lotsof discovered ibogaine's remarkable anti-addiction properties, sparking decades of research into its use for treating opioid, cocaine, and alcohol dependence.
