# Estrogen

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Promotes female secondary sexual characteristics, regulates the
menstrual cycle, and supports pregnancy. Increases fat storage, promotes skin hydration, and
may cause breast tenderness or fluid retention.

**Natural Occurrence:** In humans and animals it is synthesized in
the ovaries (women) and testes (men), and adrenal glands from cholesterol via enzymes like
aromatase.
**Appearance:** Estrogen is not visible in the
body, existing in trace amounts in blood and tissues.

## History

Estrogen was first identified in the late 1920s by biochemists Edward Doisy and Edgar Allen, who isolated estriol from the urine of pregnant women in 1929. Premarin (conjugated estrogens derived from pregnant mare urine) became commercially available in 1941 and was the most prescribed drug in America by the 1990s, primarily for menopausal hormone replacement therapy. Synthetic estrogens also became the foundation of the oral contraceptive pill approved in 1960, one of the most socially transformative pharmaceutical developments in history, and estrogen therapy remains central to transgender medicine and women's healthcare.
