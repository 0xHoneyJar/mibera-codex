# Iboga

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Ibogaine induces intense, long-lasting hallucinations, often
described as dream-like or introspective visions. Physically it can increase heart rate and blood
pressure, and may invoke nausea, vomiting, and tremors. Ibogaine is highly toxic at high doses
with risks including cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.

**Natural Occurrence:** Found primarily in the root bark of
Tabernanthe iboga, the plant grows in tropical rainforest and is harvested for its psychoactive
and medicinal properties..
**Appearance:** Tabernanthe iboga has dark
green leaves, yellow, or white flowers, and brownish root bark. The root bark, when dried,
appears as reddish-brown to dark brown fibrous material, often ground into powder for
consumption.

## History

Tabernanthe iboga has been used for centuries by the Bwiti religion of the Fang and Mitsogo peoples of Gabon and Cameroon as a central sacrament in initiation rites, where large doses of root bark are consumed to induce multi-day visionary experiences that connect initiates with ancestral spirits. French explorers first documented iboga use in the 1860s, and the alkaloid ibogaine was isolated in 1901. The Bwiti religion experienced a resurgence in the mid-20th century as a form of cultural resistance against colonialism, and the Gabonese government declared iboga a national treasure in 2000, recognizing its profound cultural and spiritual significance.
