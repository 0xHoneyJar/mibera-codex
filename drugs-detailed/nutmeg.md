# Nutmeg

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Deliriant, mild euphoria, relaxation, and occasional visual
distortions. Effects are subtle and often described as cannabis-like.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to the Moluccas (spice island) in
Indonesia, this tree produces nutmeg seeds and mace (seed aril).
**Appearance:** Brown, oval seeds, encased
in a red lacy mace aril within a hard shell. Ground nutmeg is a light brown powder with a warm
spicy aroma.

## History

Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) originated in the Banda Islands of Indonesia and was one of the most coveted spices in the world for centuries, driving European colonial wars including the Dutch massacre of the Bandanese people in 1621 to secure a monopoly. Its psychoactive properties were documented by medieval Arab physicians, and the 12th-century German mystic Hildegard von Bingen described nutmeg's mood-altering effects. Nutmeg intoxication has been reported throughout history, notably in prisons and among those without access to other substances, and the spice was famously explored by Malcolm X during his incarceration, as described in his autobiography.
