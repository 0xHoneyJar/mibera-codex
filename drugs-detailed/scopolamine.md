# Scopolamine

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Delirium, hallucinations, confusion, and disorienting. Physically
can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, pupil dilation, rapid heartbeat, urinary retention,
constipation, and hyperthermia.

**Natural Occurrence:** Scopolamine occurs naturally in Datura and
Henbane.

- Datura (Datura stramonium, D. innoxia, D. metel): Found in all plant parts, with highest
concentrations in seeds and leaves. Datura species are weeds growing in temperate
and tropical regions worldwide, often in disturbed soils.

**- Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger):** Native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia, scopolamine is
present in seeds and leaves, alongside hyoscyamine. It thrives in disturbed soils and
wastelands.

- Belladona, a 1-2 meter tall perennial herb that produces small red to black berries.
- Datura has large, coarse green leaves, trumpet-shaped white or purple flowers, and
spiky seed pods.

- Henbane has dull green, hairy leaves, yellowish flowers with purple veins, and small
seed capsules.

## History

Scopolamine was first isolated from Scopolia plants by German chemist Albert Ladenburg in 1880, and it has been used in various Solanaceae plants (Datura, henbane, belladonna) since antiquity for ritual and medicinal purposes. It was infamously used as a "truth serum" by police and intelligence agencies in the early 20th century, and the CIA explored it during Project MKUltra in the 1950s. In modern times, scopolamine gained notoriety as "devil's breath" (burundanga) in Colombia, where criminals allegedly use it to render victims compliant, while medically it remains widely used as a patch for motion sickness.
