### Effects & Properties

**General Effects:** Visual and auditory hallucinations, kaleidoscopic variations in the

depth of vision, muscular relaxation and or tension, distortion of tactile sensations, lack of ability

to focus / concentrate, altered mood and perception of time.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** C12H17N2O4P (Psilocybin) is produced by

over 200 species of fungi, primarily in the genus Psilocybe. These mushrooms grow worldwide

in grasslands and pastures, forest and woodland, as well as tropical and or subtropical regions.

Common in South America, Southeast Asia, and Australia.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): Group 1 Psilocybes have a

cap from 2-7cm in diameter, viscid in wet weather but shiny when dry. Colour of the caps range

from whitish with a pale yellow centre at first, becoming entirely honey brown to reddish brown.

Often stains blue-green when old / injured. The stem grows up to 11cm tall, hollow, slender,

smooth, and slightly thickened downwards.

Group 2 Psilocybes have caps ranging from 1-5cm in diameter, with the color ranging from pale

brown to tawny orange, reddish brown, brownish yellow, or dark brown when older. Bruising

causes blue-green staining. The stems vary from 4-12cm tall, slender, and a silky fibrous

texture.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Psilocybin mushroom tea has roots in Mesoamerican cultures, where the Aztecs and Mazatec peoples consumed psilocybin mushrooms (called teonanacatl, "flesh of the gods") in sacred rituals dating back at least 2,000 years. R. Gordon Wasson brought Western attention to their use after participating in a Mazatec ceremony with curandera Maria Sabina in Oaxaca, Mexico in 1955. The modern practice of brewing mushrooms as tea became popular in psychedelic counterculture from the 1960s onward, offering a gentler onset than eating dried mushrooms, and remains a common preparation method in contemporary psychedelic and rave-adjacent communities.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Caffeine consumption likely began in Ethiopia, where legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a goat herder named Kaldi around the 9th century CE who noticed his goats became energized after eating coffee berries. Tea consumption in China dates back even further, traditionally to Emperor Shen Nung around 2737 BCE. Coffeehouses became vital centers of intellectual and political discourse in the Ottoman Empire, Europe, and colonial America, and caffeine is now the most widely consumed psychoactive substance on Earth, with over two billion cups of coffee consumed daily worldwide.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Serotonin was first identified in 1948 by Maurice Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page at the Cleveland Clinic, who isolated it from blood serum and named it for its vasoconstrictive properties (serum tonic). Its role as a neurotransmitter in the brain was established in the 1950s by Betty Twarog and Irvine Page. The understanding that endogenous serotonin regulates mood, sleep, appetite, and well-being has been foundational to modern psychiatry, leading to the development of SSRIs in the 1980s and reshaping how humanity understands the neurochemistry of baseline contentment and emotional resilience.

### Mibera Integration

**Archetype:** Chicago Detroit

**Ancestor:** Hindu

**Swag Score:** 3

---

### Visual

**Image Files:** chicagodetroit_hindu_sugarcane.PNG

---

### Effects & Properties

**General Effects:** Increased energy. Rapidly increasing blood sugar due to its high

glycemic index, causes a quick rise in blood glucose, stimulating insulin release. Moderate

consumption is generally safe, but excessive intake is linked to weight gain, type 2 diabetes,

dental caries, and cardiovascular risks. Overconsumption can also lead to obesity, insulin

resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Dental caries are also a significant concern due to

sucrose’s fermentation by oral bacteria.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** Sugarcane stalks contain 12-20% sucrose

by weight, making it a primary commercial source. The plant, native to Southeast Asia, is

cultivated to tropical regions like Brazil, India, and the Caribbean. In sugarcane, sucrose is

stored in the stalks, then refined to isolate it as white or brown sugar.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): Juicy, fibrous stalks, which are

green to brownish and segmented. Sugarcane juice is a cloudy, sweet liquid (10-15% sucrose)

that turns brownish when processed into molasses or raw sugar.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Physical):** 

---

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Sugarcane was first domesticated in New Guinea around 8000 BCE and spread to India, where the process of crystallizing sugar was developed around 350 CE. Arab traders brought sugar production techniques to the Mediterranean, and European colonial powers established massive sugar plantations in the Caribbean and Americas from the 16th century onward, fueling the transatlantic slave trade. Sugar became one of the most influential commodities in world history, transforming global economies, diets, and public health, and its overconsumption is now linked to the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

### Effects & Properties

**General Effects:** Kykeon may produce mild psychoactive effects at high doses, and

could theoretically induce visionary experiences. Common side effects include nausea,

vomiting, dizziness, and muscle cramps due to vasoconstriction. High doses can cause

ergotism, a serious condition with symptoms like severe vasoconstriction, convulsions,

hallucinations, or psychosis.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** Found in ergot sclerotia on grasses like rye,

wheat, and barley, with concentrations varying. The fungus thrives in damp conditions,

historically contaminating grain supplies in Europe.

Kykeon contained ergot alkaloids stems from the use of barley in its recipe.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): In nature, it exists in

ergot-infected grains, showing as a dark purple to black sclerotia which replace healthy grain

kernels. These sclerotia are hard and irregular, contrasting with the lighter grain.

Kykeon itself is a liquid beverage, likely cloudy or brownish due to barley and mint, and would

resemble a grain-based porridge or drink, not a pure chemical.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Physical):** 

---

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Kykeon was the sacred ritual drink consumed by initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries in ancient Greece, ceremonies held annually for nearly 2,000 years (circa 1500 BCE to 392 CE) at the sanctuary of Eleusis near Athens. The exact recipe remains debated, but it is known to have contained barley, water, and mint; scholars including R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, and Carl Ruck proposed in their 1978 book "The Road to Eleusis" that ergot-contaminated barley may have provided psychoactive alkaloids similar to LSD. The Mysteries were considered the most important spiritual event in the ancient Greek world, with initiates including Plato, Sophocles, and Cicero reporting profound, life-changing visionary experiences.

### Effects & Properties

**General Effects:** In the brain, dopamine mediates reward, pleasure, and

motivation, contributing to feelings of satisfaction. It enhances focus, attention, and

goal-directed behavior, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. Physically, dopamine regulates

blood pressure, heart rate, and kidney function by acting as a vasodilator or vasoconstrictor.

Excessive dopamine can cause agitation, paranoia, or psychosis.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** In animals, dopamine regulates

neurological and physiological processes, In plants, its role is less clear but may involve

defense or signaling. It is an endogenous compound, not requiring external administration for

natural effects.

**- Animal:** Synthesized in the brain, adrenal glands, and peripheral tissues from the amino

acid L-tyrosine via tyrosine hydroxlase. It is found in high concentration in the substantia

nigra, ventral tegmental area, and basal ganglia, playing a role in movement, reward,

and cognition. It is also present in blood and kidneys.

**- Plants:** Found in certain plants, notably bananas (Musa species) and Mucuna pruriens

(velvet beans), where it may function in stress responses or as a precursor to other

compounds. Concentrations in plants are low and not psychoactive when consumed due

to metabolism and blood-brain barrier.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): In nature, dopamine is not

visible as it exists in trace amounts within tissues or fluids. In its pure form, dopamine is a white

to off-white crystalline powder.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Physical):**

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Dopamine was first synthesized in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at the Wellcome Laboratories in London, but it was long considered merely a precursor to norepinephrine with no independent function. In 1958, Swedish pharmacologist Arvid Carlsson demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in its own right, work for which he received the Nobel Prize in 2000. The understanding of dopamine's central role in motivation, reward, and pleasure has profoundly shaped modern neuroscience and popular culture, making "dopamine" synonymous with the neurochemistry of drive, ambition, and the pursuit of satisfaction.

**General Real World Trait History:** Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) has been used since antiquity, with references in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman texts dating back to at least 1550 BCE (the Ebers Papyrus). The Greek physician Dioscorides described its use as an anesthetic and pain reliever in the 1st century CE, and it was a key ingredient in medieval European "witches' flying ointments" alongside belladonna and mandrake. Henbane was also used as a beer additive in medieval Germany before the Reinheitsgebot (purity law) of 1516 restricted beer ingredients, and archaeological evidence of henbane seeds has been found at Viking and Anglo-Saxon sites across Northern Europe.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Alprazolam (Xanax) was patented by Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) in 1971 and approved by the FDA in 1981 as the first benzodiazepine specifically indicated for panic disorder. It quickly became one of the most prescribed psychiatric medications in the United States, reflecting the era's growing recognition of anxiety disorders. By the 2010s, Xanax had become a cultural phenomenon in hip-hop and SoundCloud rap ("Xanax music"), and its recreational abuse as a "downer" in party and rave contexts has contributed to a broader benzodiazepine crisis.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Iproniazid was originally developed in the early 1950s as a treatment for tuberculosis, derived from the rocket fuel hydrazine. In 1952, physicians at Sea View Hospital on Staten Island, New York noticed that TB patients treated with iproniazid became unusually euphoric and energetic, leading to the landmark discovery that it functioned as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) with antidepressant properties. Iproniazid became the first commercially available antidepressant in 1958, ushering in the psychopharmacological revolution and fundamentally changing psychiatry's approach to depression, though it was later withdrawn due to liver toxicity concerns.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** The practice of achieving altered states of consciousness through rhythmic drumming, chanting, hyperventilation, prolonged dance, and sensory deprivation predates all known drug use and may be as old as human consciousness itself, with evidence in Paleolithic cave art dating back 30,000-40,000 years. Trance states achieved without chemical substances are central to diverse spiritual traditions worldwide, from Aboriginal Australian corroborees to Haitian Vodou possession ceremonies to Orthodox Jewish ecstatic prayer (hitbodedut) to Sufi whirling dervish practices. This lineage connects directly to the modern rave experience, where sustained rhythmic movement, bass frequencies, and communal energy can induce non-chemical altered states, making ancestral trance the oldest and most universal human technology for transcendence.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** MMDA (3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine) was first synthesized and pharmacologically explored by Alexander Shulgin in the 1960s, who described it in detail in his 1991 book PiHKAL. Shulgin noted its unique sensory-enhancing and empathogenic qualities, describing it as producing a "beautiful" experience distinct from both MDA and MDMA, with pronounced visual effects and emotional warmth. MMDA remained relatively obscure compared to its more famous relatives and is derived from the essential oil myristicin found in nutmeg, linking this synthetic psychedelic to one of the world's oldest spice-based intoxicants.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Amphetamine was first synthesized by Romanian chemist Lazar Edeleanu in Berlin in 1887, and its dextro-rotatory isomer (dextroamphetamine) was identified as the more potent stimulant enantiomer. Smith, Kline and French marketed dextroamphetamine as Dexedrine in 1937 for narcolepsy and depression, and it was widely distributed to Allied soldiers during World War II as a performance enhancer. Dextroamphetamine became a foundation of modern ADHD treatment through medications like Adderall (approved 1996), and its non-medical use is widespread in academic, professional, and party contexts.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Arundo donax (giant reed) has been used since antiquity in the Mediterranean region, with ancient Egyptians and Greeks employing it for making reeds for musical instruments, pens, and building materials. Its psychoactive potential was largely overlooked until the late 20th century, when researchers identified DMT and related tryptamine alkaloids in the plant's rhizomes and flowers. While not traditionally consumed as an entheogen, Arundo donax's DMT content has made it of interest to the modern psychedelic community, particularly as it grows abundantly as an invasive species in California and other warm climates.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Mucuna pruriens (velvet bean) has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for over 3,000 years, described in ancient texts as a treatment for Kampavata (a condition resembling Parkinson's disease), male infertility, and general vitality. It is one of the richest natural sources of L-DOPA, the direct precursor to dopamine, which was confirmed by modern pharmacological research in the 1930s. The plant's L-DOPA content (3-6% in seeds) has attracted growing scientific interest for its potential in treating Parkinson's disease and as a natural mood enhancer, and it has become a popular supplement in the biohacking and nootropics communities.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Lithium was first discovered as an element by Swedish chemist Johan August Arfwedson in 1817 in the mineral petalite. Its psychiatric applications were pioneered by Australian psychiatrist John Cade, who in 1949 discovered lithium's remarkable ability to calm manic episodes after testing lithium salts on guinea pigs, marking one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of psychiatry. Despite Cade's discovery, lithium was not approved by the FDA for bipolar disorder treatment until 1970, partly due to pharmaceutical companies' lack of interest in patenting a naturally occurring element, and it remains the gold standard mood stabilizer to this day.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Ayahuasca has been used by Indigenous Amazonian peoples for at least 1,000 years and possibly much longer, with the earliest archaeological evidence of ayahuasca preparation found in a Bolivian cave bundle dating to approximately 1000 CE. The brew, combining DMT-containing Psychotria viridis leaves with MAO-inhibiting Banisteriopsis caapi vine, was first documented by Western explorers including Richard Spruce in 1851 and later studied extensively by Richard Evans Schultes in the 1940s. The global ayahuasca movement exploded from the 1990s onward through Brazilian syncretic churches (Santo Daime and Uniao do Vegetal) and a growing network of retreat centers, making ayahuasca one of the most culturally significant psychedelic phenomena of the 21st century.

### History

**General Real World Trait History:** Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) is one of the most mythologized plants in Western history, with references in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 30:14), ancient Egyptian texts, and Greek writings by Theophrastus and Dioscorides dating to the 4th century BCE. Medieval European folklore held that the mandrake root screamed when pulled from the ground and that the sound could kill the harvester, leading to elaborate rituals involving dogs tied to the root. Mandrake was a key ingredient in medieval surgical anesthesia (the "soporific sponge") and in witches' "flying ointments," and its human-shaped root made it one of the most potent symbols in Western occult tradition.
