# Mimosa Tenuiflora

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, altered sense of time and
reality, euphoria, and profound spiritual or mystical experiences. Physically it can increase heart
rate and blood pressure, pupil dilation, and in some cases nausea. In higher doses or
unprepared settings can cause anxiety, panic, or disorientation.

**Natural Occurrence:** In plants, DMT likely serves as a defense
against herbivores or pathogens. In humans its endogenous presence is under study with
theories linking it to dreaming, near-death experiences, or spiritual phenomena (speculative).

**- Plants:** Found in numerous plant species, particularly those used in traditional
psychoactive preparations, such as Psychotria viridis (chacruna), Banisteriopsis caapi,
Mimosa tenuiflora, and Acacia species. It is present in leaves, bark, or roots, often in low
concentrations.

**- Animals:** Trace amounts are detected in the brain, blood, and urine of mammals,
including humans.

**- Fungi and Toads:** Present in some fungi (Psilocybe species, etc) and certain toad
venoms.
**Appearance:** DMT is not visible in plants or
animals but is extracted as a powder or resin from plant material (Mimosa tenuiflora root bark
yields a reddish-brown extract, in Ayahuasca it is part of a dark, bitter liquid brew).

## History

Mimosa tenuiflora (also known as jurema or tepezcohuite) has been used by Indigenous peoples of northeastern Brazil in the sacred jurema ritual for centuries, where a DMT-containing drink called vinho de jurema is consumed for visionary and healing purposes. The Aztecs also reportedly used the plant, which they called tepezcohuite, primarily for wound healing and skin burns. In the modern era, Mimosa tenuiflora root bark became one of the most widely sourced DMT-containing plant materials in the global psychedelic community from the 2000s onward, used for ayahuasca analogs and DMT extraction.
