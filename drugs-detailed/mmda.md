# MMDA

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Euphoria, emotional openness, vivid sensory perception, mild
visual hallucinations.

**Natural Occurrence:** MMDA does not occur naturally. Primarily
used recreationally, it is used in psychedelic communities for its entactogenic and
sensory-enhancing effects, often compared to MDMA.

## History

MMDA (3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine) was first synthesized and pharmacologically explored by Alexander Shulgin in the 1960s, who described it in detail in his 1991 book PiHKAL. Shulgin noted its unique sensory-enhancing and empathogenic qualities, describing it as producing a "beautiful" experience distinct from both MDA and MDMA, with pronounced visual effects and emotional warmth. MMDA remained relatively obscure compared to its more famous relatives and is derived from the essential oil myristicin found in nutmeg, linking this synthetic psychedelic to one of the world's oldest spice-based intoxicants.
