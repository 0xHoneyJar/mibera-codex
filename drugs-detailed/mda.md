Potential risks include anxiety, paranoia, dehydration, and hyperthermia.

**Natural Occurrence:** MDA does not occur naturally.

## History

MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) was first synthesized by German chemists G. Mannish and W. Jacobsohn in 1910, and its psychoactive effects were explored by the US military in the 1950s as part of Project MKUltra. It gained the street name "the love drug" in the 1960s counterculture and was used therapeutically by psychotherapist Claudio Naranjo before being classified as a Schedule I substance in 1970. MDA served as a precursor to the development of MDMA and influenced the entactogen class of drugs that would later become central to rave culture.
