# Mushrooms

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Visual and auditory hallucinations, kaleidoscopic variations in the
depth of vision, muscular relaxation and or tension, distortion of tactile sensations, lack of ability
to focus / concentrate, altered mood and perception of time.

**Natural Occurrence:** C12H17N2O4P (Psilocybin) is produced by
over 200 species of fungi, primarily in the genus Psilocybe. These mushrooms grow worldwide
in grasslands and pastures, forest and woodland, as well as tropical and or subtropical regions.
Common in South America, Southeast Asia, and Australia.
**Appearance:** Group 1 Psilocybes have a
cap from 2-7cm in diameter, viscid in wet weather but shiny when dry. Colour of the caps range
from whitish with a pale yellow centre at first, becoming entirely honey brown to reddish brown.
Often stains blue-green when old / injured. The stem grows up to 11cm tall, hollow, slender,
smooth, and slightly thickened downwards.
Group 2 Psilocybes have caps ranging from 1-5cm in diameter, with the color ranging from pale
brown to tawny orange, reddish brown, brownish yellow, or dark brown when older. Bruising
causes blue-green staining. The stems vary from 4-12cm tall, slender, and a silky fibrous
texture.

## History

Psilocybin mushrooms have been used ritually for thousands of years, with stone mushroom effigies from Guatemala and Mexico dating to at least 1000 BCE suggesting an ancient Mesoamerican mushroom cult. R. Gordon Wasson's 1957 Life magazine article "Seeking the Magic Mushroom," describing his experience with Maria Sabina in Oaxaca, ignited Western interest, and Albert Hofmann subsequently isolated and synthesized psilocybin in 1958. Magic mushrooms became a cornerstone of 1960s psychedelic counterculture, were classified as Schedule I in the US in 1970, and are now experiencing a clinical renaissance with FDA breakthrough therapy designation for psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression.
