# Shroom Tea

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Visual and auditory hallucinations, kaleidoscopic variations in the
depth of vision, muscular relaxation and or tension, distortion of tactile sensations, lack of ability
to focus / concentrate, altered mood and perception of time.

**Natural Occurrence:** C12H17N2O4P (Psilocybin) is produced by over 200 species of fungi, primarily in the genus Psilocybe. These mushrooms grow worldwide
in grasslands and pastures, forest and woodland, as well as tropical and or subtropical regions.
Common in South America, Southeast Asia, and Australia.
**Appearance:** Group 1 Psilocybes have a
cap from 2-7cm in diameter, viscid in wet weather but shiny when dry. Colour of the caps range
from whitish with a pale yellow centre at first, becoming entirely honey brown to reddish brown.
Often stains blue-green when old / injured. The stem grows up to 11cm tall, hollow, slender,
smooth, and slightly thickened downwards.
Group 2 Psilocybes have caps ranging from 1-5cm in diameter, with the color ranging from pale
brown to tawny orange, reddish brown, brownish yellow, or dark brown when older. Bruising
causes blue-green staining. The stems vary from 4-12cm tall, slender, and a silky fibrous
texture.

## History

Psilocybin mushroom tea has roots in Mesoamerican cultures, where the Aztecs and Mazatec peoples consumed psilocybin mushrooms (called teonanacatl, "flesh of the gods") in sacred rituals dating back at least 2,000 years. R. Gordon Wasson brought Western attention to their use after participating in a Mazatec ceremony with curandera Maria Sabina in Oaxaca, Mexico in 1955. The modern practice of brewing mushrooms as tea became popular in psychedelic counterculture from the 1960s onward, offering a gentler onset than eating dried mushrooms, and remains a common preparation method in contemporary psychedelic and rave-adjacent communities.
