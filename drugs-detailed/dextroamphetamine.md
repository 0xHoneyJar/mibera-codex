therapeutic doses. Recreational doses can induce intense euphoria, increased confidence, and

## History

Amphetamine was first synthesized by Romanian chemist Lazar Edeleanu in Berlin in 1887, and its dextro-rotatory isomer (dextroamphetamine) was identified as the more potent stimulant enantiomer. Smith, Kline and French marketed dextroamphetamine as Dexedrine in 1937 for narcolepsy and depression, and it was widely distributed to Allied soldiers during World War II as a performance enhancer. Dextroamphetamine became a foundation of modern ADHD treatment through medications like Adderall (approved 1996), and its non-medical use is widespread in academic, professional, and party contexts.
