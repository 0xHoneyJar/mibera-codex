# Psilacetin

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, euphoria, and altered
perception of time and space.

**Natural Occurrence:** Psilacetin is a synthetic compound and
does not occur naturally. Used primarily recreationally for psychedelic experiences in spiritual or
social settings.

## History

Psilacetin (4-AcO-DMT, or O-acetylpsilocin) was first synthesized by Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler at Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland in 1963 as part of their research into psilocybin analogs. It remained relatively obscure for decades until the rise of the online research chemical market in the 2000s, where it was sold as a legal psilocybin prodrug that converts to psilocin in the body. Psilacetin became popular in psychedelic communities for its mushroom-like effects and more consistent dosing compared to natural psilocybin mushrooms, and it occupies a legal gray area in many countries.
