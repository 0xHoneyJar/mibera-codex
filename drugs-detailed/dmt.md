# DMT

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, altered sense of time and
reality, euphoria, and profound spiritual or mystical experiences. Physically it can increase heart
rate and blood pressure, pupil dilation, and in some cases nausea. In higher doses or
unprepared settings can cause anxiety, panic, or disorientation.

**Natural Occurrence:** In plants, DMT likely serves as a defense
against herbivores or pathogens. In humans its endogenous presence is under study with
theories linking it to dreaming, near-death experiences, or spiritual phenomena (speculative).

**- Plants:** Found in numerous plant species, particularly those used in traditional
psychoactive preparations, such as Psychotria viridis (chacruna), Banisteriopsis caapi,
Mimosa tenuiflora, and Acacia species. It is present in leaves, bark, or roots, often in low
concentrations.

**- Animals:** Trace amounts are detected in the brain, blood, and urine of mammals,
including humans.

**- Fungi and Toads:** Present in some fungi (Psilocybe species, etc) and certain toad
venoms.
**Appearance:** DMT is not visible in plants or
animals but is extracted as a powder or resin from plant material (Mimosa tenuiflora root bark
yields a reddish-brown extract, in Ayahuasca it is part of a dark, bitter liquid brew).

## History

DMT was first synthesized by Canadian chemist Richard Manske in 1931, though its psychoactive properties were not recognized until Hungarian chemist Stephen Szara self-administered it via injection in 1956 and reported intense visionary experiences. Indigenous Amazonian peoples had been using DMT-containing plant preparations such as ayahuasca and snuffs like yopo for thousands of years prior. Rick Strassman's clinical research at the University of New Mexico in the 1990s, published as "DMT: The Spirit Molecule," reignited scientific and popular interest, and DMT has since become a substance of fascination in psychedelic and electronic music subcultures.
