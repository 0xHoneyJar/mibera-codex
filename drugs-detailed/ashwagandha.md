# Ashwagandha

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Mild calming effects, reducing anxiety and stress without
sedation. Enhances mood, focus, and cognitive function with chronic use. Effects are subtle,
requiring 2-8 weeks for noticeable benefits.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to India, the Middle East, and parts
of Africa, this small shrub grows in arid and semi-arid regions. Used in Ayurvedic medicine for
stress, anxiety, fatigue, and cognitive support. Available as capsules, powders, or teas in herbal
supplements.
**Appearance:** The plant has dull green, oval
leaves, small greenish-yellow flowers, and red-orange berries encased in papery calyx. Dried
roots are light brown to tan, often ground into a beige to brownish powder.

## History

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been one of the most important herbs in Ayurvedic medicine for over 3,000 years, described in the foundational Ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita as a rasayana (rejuvenator) that promotes longevity, vitality, and mental clarity. Its Sanskrit name means "smell of the horse," referring both to its distinctive odor and the traditional belief that it confers the strength and vigor of a stallion. Ashwagandha experienced a massive surge in Western popularity in the 2010s-2020s as an adaptogen supplement, driven by clinical studies demonstrating its efficacy in reducing cortisol and anxiety, making it one of the most commercially successful crossovers from traditional medicine to modern wellness culture.
