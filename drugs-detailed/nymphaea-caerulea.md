## History

Nymphaea caerulea (the blue Egyptian lotus) was sacred in ancient Egyptian civilization, appearing extensively in art, temple decorations, and funerary practices from as early as 3000 BCE, where it symbolized creation, rebirth, and the sun. It was likely consumed as a wine infusion during religious ceremonies and social gatherings for its mildly sedative and euphoric effects. The flower was rediscovered by Western ethnobotanists in the late 20th century and has since gained a following in the modern herbal and psychoactive plant communities.
