# Lamotrigine

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing medication
primarily used to treat epilepsy (to control seizures) and bipolar disorder (to prevent mood
swings, particularly depressive episodes). Common side effects include dehydration, dizziness,
headache, nausea, and in some cases skin rashes.

**Natural Occurrence:** Lamotrigine does not occur naturally and is
purely a synthetic compound.

## History

Lamotrigine was developed by GlaxoSmithKline's precursor Wellcome Research Laboratories in the UK during the 1980s, initially as an anticonvulsant for epilepsy. It received FDA approval in the United States in 1994 for epilepsy treatment and was subsequently approved for bipolar disorder maintenance therapy in 2003. Its relatively mild side effect profile compared to older mood stabilizers like lithium has made it one of the most widely prescribed psychiatric medications worldwide.
