# Kratom

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** At low doses, produces stimulation, increased energy, alertness,
and sociability. At higher doses, it induces sedation, euphoria, and opioid-like analgesia.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to Southeast Asia (Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, etc) this tree grows in tropical forests. Traditionally chewed or brewed as
tea in Southeast Asia for energy, pain relief, and social enhancement.
**Appearance:** Typically has glossy dark
green leaves (between 10-15cm), yellowish flowers, and grows as a tree up to 25 meters. Dried
kratom leaves are green to brownish-green, often ground into a fine green or brown powder with
an earthy, bitter taste and odor.

## History

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) has been used in traditional medicine in Thailand and Malaysia for centuries, where laborers chewed the leaves to combat fatigue and increase productivity during long work days. The Dutch colonial botanist Pieter Korthals first formally described the plant in 1839, and Thailand banned kratom in 1943 under the Kratom Act, reportedly to protect opium tax revenue, before lifting the ban in 2021. Kratom gained significant Western attention in the 2010s as an opioid alternative for pain management and addiction recovery, sparking intense regulatory debate, with the DEA's 2016 attempt to schedule it met with unprecedented public opposition.
