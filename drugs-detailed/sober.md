## History

Serotonin was first identified in 1948 by Maurice Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page at the Cleveland Clinic, who isolated it from blood serum and named it for its vasoconstrictive properties (serum tonic). Its role as a neurotransmitter in the brain was established in the 1950s by Betty Twarog and Irvine Page. The understanding that endogenous serotonin regulates mood, sleep, appetite, and well-being has been foundational to modern psychiatry, leading to the development of SSRIs in the 1980s and reshaping how humanity understands the neurochemistry of baseline contentment and emotional resilience.
