# Bhang

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Anti-inflammatory, relaxation, reduce anxiety.

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to South Asia, Bhang grows in
temperate and tropical regions. Bhang is used in cultural and religious contexts as a drink,
paste, or edible for relaxation and spiritual purposes.
**Appearance:** Green serrated leaves, dense,
resinous buds, and small seeds.

## History

Bhang is one of the oldest cannabis preparations in the world, with documented use in India dating back to at least 1000 BCE in the Atharva Veda, one of the four sacred Hindu texts, where cannabis was listed among the five sacred plants. It holds a unique legal and cultural status in India as a preparation associated with Lord Shiva, consumed widely during the festivals of Holi and Maha Shivaratri in the form of bhang lassi (a yogurt drink) or bhang thandai (a spiced milk drink). Government-licensed bhang shops operate legally throughout India, particularly in the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, making bhang one of the few cannabis products with continuous, unbroken legal use spanning millennia.
