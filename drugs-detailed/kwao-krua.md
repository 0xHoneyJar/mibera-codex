# Kwao Krua

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Menopausal symptom relief, maintaining bone density in
estrogen-deficient models, promoting collagen production, skin elasticity, and wrinkle reduction.
It may also have antioxidant effects and inhibit growth of breast cancer cell lines, though in high
doses may promote estrogen-sensitive tumors. Mild side effects include breast tenderness,
bloating, headaches, and irregular periods.

**Natural Occurrence:** The substances are unique to Puerarie
mirifica.
**Appearance:** The plant’s tuberous roots
resemble potatoes in their raw form, with a brownish exterior and whitish interior. Dried and
powdered, the roots appear as light brown to beige with an earthy odor.

## History

Kwao Krua (Pueraria mirifica) has been used in traditional Thai medicine for centuries, with the earliest known written reference appearing in a palm-leaf manuscript from Myanmar dating to 1227 CE, describing its rejuvenating and feminizing properties. The plant was formally identified by the Thai botanist Luang Anusarnsuntarakromkarnpithak in 1931 and documented scientifically by Kashemsanta in 1952. It gained international attention in the late 20th century for its potent phytoestrogens, particularly miroestrol, and is now widely marketed as a natural supplement for menopausal relief and breast enhancement.
