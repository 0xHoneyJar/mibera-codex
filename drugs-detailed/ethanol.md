# Ethanol

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. In small
amounts, it produces relaxation, lowered inhibitions and mild euphoria. In higher doses, it
impairs motor skills, judgment, and can cause intoxication, nausea, or unconsciousness.

**Natural Occurrence:** Alcohol occurs naturally through
fermentation, where microorganisms like yeast convert sugars into ethanol and CO2. It’s found
in trace amounts in overripe fruits, fermented plant saps, or natural beverages like kombucha.
**Appearance:** Clear, colorless liquid at room
temperature with a slightly sweet, alcoholic odor and a burning taste.

## History

The distillation of ethanol was pioneered by Persian alchemist Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi around 864 CE, building on earlier fermentation knowledge that dates back to at least 7000 BCE in China. Arab alchemists refined distillation techniques that eventually spread to medieval Europe, where monasteries became centers of spirit production, giving rise to whiskey, brandy, and vodka traditions. The word "alcohol" itself derives from the Arabic al-kuhl, and distilled ethanol transformed both medicine and culture, serving as the basis for antiseptics, fuel, and the global spirits industry.
