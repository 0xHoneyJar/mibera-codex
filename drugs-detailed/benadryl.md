# Benadryl

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Mild sedation, drowsiness, and reduced alertness, making it
effective for insomnia.

**Natural Occurrence:** Benadryl does not occur naturally, it was
first synthesized in 1943 by George Rievschl and is produced in laboratories. Widely available
as an over-the-counter medication as for now, for allergies, insomnia, and motion sickness.

## History

Diphenhydramine (marketed as Benadryl) was synthesized in 1943 by George Rieveschl, a professor at the University of Cincinnati, and it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the FDA in 1946. Parke-Davis marketed it as Benadryl, and it transitioned to over-the-counter status in the 1980s, becoming one of the most widely used allergy and sleep medications. In the 2020s, Benadryl gained negative attention due to the dangerous "Benadryl Challenge" on social media, which involved taking high doses to induce deliriant hallucinations, highlighting the substance's toxic potential at supratherapeutic doses.
