# Tabernaemontana

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Mild psychoactive properties, calming and stimulant effects,
depending on preparation and species. May cause lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate,
and mild sedation on lower doses.

**Natural Occurrence:** Found in species like Tabernaemontana
divaricata (widely distributed in Asia), Tabernaemontana pandacaqui (Southeast Asia, Pacific
Islands), and Tabernaemontana africana (Africa). It is used in traditional medicine for fever, pain,
and snakebites. Some species are used in rituals for their sedative or psychoactive effects.
**Appearance:** The plants typically have
glossy green leaves, white or cream-colored flowers, and woody roots or bark. Dried root bark
or leaves appear as brown to reddish-brown fibrous material, often ground into powder before
usage.

## History

Tabernaemontana species have been used in traditional medicine across Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia for centuries, with various species employed for treating pain, fever, infections, and snakebites. The genus was named by French botanist Charles Plumier in honor of the 16th-century German herbalist Jakob Theodor von Bergzabern (Latinized as Tabernaemontanus). In the Bwiti tradition of Gabon and Cameroon, certain Tabernaemontana species are used alongside Tabernanthe iboga in ritual contexts, and modern pharmacological research has identified numerous bioactive alkaloids with potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases and addiction.
