# Xanax

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Induces calmness, relaxation, and mild sedation. At higher doses
can cause drowsiness, euphoria, or a sense of detachment. Physically it reduces muscle
tension, slows reaction times, and in some cases invokes dizziness or coordination impairment.
It may also cause dry mouth or mild nausea.

**Natural Occurrence:** Xanax does not occur naturally.

## History

Alprazolam (Xanax) was patented by Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) in 1971 and approved by the FDA in 1981 as the first benzodiazepine specifically indicated for panic disorder. It quickly became one of the most prescribed psychiatric medications in the United States, reflecting the era's growing recognition of anxiety disorders. By the 2010s, Xanax had become a cultural phenomenon in hip-hop and SoundCloud rap ("Xanax music"), and its recreational abuse as a "downer" in party and rave contexts has contributed to a broader benzodiazepine crisis.
