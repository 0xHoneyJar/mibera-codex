# Bufotenine

## Effects & Properties

## History

Bufotenine was first isolated from toad skin (Bufo genus) in 1893 by the Austrian chemist Handovsky, and its presence in the seeds of Anadenanthera peregrina was later confirmed. Indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and South America have used bufotenine-containing snuffs such as cohoba and yopo for thousands of years in shamanic rituals for divination and spirit communication. The substance was studied in the mid-20th century by researchers including Fabing and Hawkins (1956), who controversially administered it to prison inmates, sparking debates about its psychoactive classification that continue today.
