# Sassafras

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Stimulant, anti-inflammatory, metabolite, relaxation.

**Natural Occurrence:** Traditionally, sassafras root bark or leaves
were used in Native American and early American medicine for fever, colds, and rheumatism, as
well as a flavoring agent. Found in the root bark, leaves, and wood of this deciduous tree native
to eastern North America.
**Appearance:** Plants with green lobed
leaves, yellow flowers, and brownish root bark. Dried root bark appears as reddish-brown to
dark brown

## History

Sassafras (Sassafras albidum) was used extensively by Native American peoples for medicinal teas, poultices, and as a food flavoring long before European contact. Spanish explorers brought sassafras back to Europe in the 16th century, where it was marketed as a cure-all and became one of the first major exports from the New World. Sassafras root bark contains safrole, which was identified in the 20th century as a precursor chemical for synthesizing MDA and MDMA, leading to its regulation under the DEA's List I chemicals in the 1990s, linking this ancient medicinal plant directly to modern rave pharmacology.
