# Acacia

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, altered sense of time and
reality, euphoria, and profound spiritual or mystical experiences. Physically it can increase heart
rate and blood pressure, pupil dilation, and in some cases nausea. In higher doses or
unprepared settings can cause anxiety, panic, or disorientation.

**Natural Occurrence:** In plants, DMT likely serves as a defense
against herbivores or pathogens. In humans its endogenous presence is under study with
theories linking it to dreaming, near-death experiences, or spiritual phenomena (speculative).

**- Plants:** Found in numerous plant species, particularly those used in traditional
psychoactive preparations, such as Psychotria viridis (chacruna), Banisteriopsis caapi,
Mimosa tenuiflora, and Acacia species. It is present in leaves, bark, or roots, often in low
concentrations.

**- Animals:** Trace amounts are detected in the brain, blood, and urine of mammals,
including humans.

**- Fungi and Toads:** Present in some fungi (Psilocybe species, etc) and certain toad
venoms.
**Appearance:** DMT is not visible in plants or
animals but is extracted as a powder or resin from plant material (Mimosa tenuiflora root bark
yields a reddish-brown extract, in Ayahuasca it is part of a dark, bitter liquid brew).

## History

DMT-containing Acacia species have been used by Aboriginal Australians for thousands of years, particularly Acacia acuminata and Acacia obtusifolia, which feature in traditional medicine and possibly ceremonial practices. The ancient Egyptians also revered Acacia nilotica as a sacred tree, and some researchers have speculated that DMT-containing Acacia species may have played a role in ancient Near Eastern religious experiences, including the biblical burning bush narrative. In the modern era, Australian Acacia species became significant to the global psychedelic community from the 1990s onward as sources of extracted DMT for ayahuasca analogs ("acaciahuasca").
