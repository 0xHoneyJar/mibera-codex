# Ancestral Trance

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Altered perceptions, vivid hallucinations, and heightened
emotional states. Often accompanied by changes in thought patterns and a distorted sense of
time.

**Natural Occurrence:** LSD doesn’t occur in nature, it is best
known and most researched psychedelic. It is the standard against which all other psychedelics
are compared. It is active at extremely low doses and is most commonly available on blotter or
in liquid form.

## History

The practice of achieving altered states of consciousness through rhythmic drumming, chanting, hyperventilation, prolonged dance, and sensory deprivation predates all known drug use and may be as old as human consciousness itself, with evidence in Paleolithic cave art dating back 30,000-40,000 years. Trance states achieved without chemical substances are central to diverse spiritual traditions worldwide, from Aboriginal Australian corroborees to Haitian Vodou possession ceremonies to Orthodox Jewish ecstatic prayer (hitbodedut) to Sufi whirling dervish practices. This lineage connects directly to the modern rave experience, where sustained rhythmic movement, bass frequencies, and communal energy can induce non-chemical altered states, making ancestral trance the oldest and most universal human technology for transcendence.
