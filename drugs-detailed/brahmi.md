**Effects:** Enhances cognitive function, memory, and focus with chronic use.
Also produces mild calming effects, reducing anxiety, and stress without sedation. Effects are

**Natural Occurrence:** Native to wetlands of India, Southeast Asia,
and Australia, this creeping herb grows in marshes and muddy shores.
**Appearance:** Plants which have small,
succulent green leaves, white to pale purple flowers, and a creeping structure. Dried Brahmi
appears as greenish-brown to brown with a mild earthy odor.

## History

Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for over 3,000 years, with references in ancient Vedic texts including the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, where it was prescribed as a medhya rasayana (intellect rejuvenator) to enhance memory, learning, and concentration. Named after Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, it was traditionally given to scholars and students to aid memorization of lengthy sacred texts. Modern clinical research beginning in the 1960s at institutions in India and Australia has validated many of these traditional claims, demonstrating significant improvements in memory acquisition and retention.
