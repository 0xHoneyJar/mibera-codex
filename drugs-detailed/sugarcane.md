# Sugarcane

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Increased energy. Rapidly increasing blood sugar due to its high
glycemic index, causes a quick rise in blood glucose, stimulating insulin release. Moderate
consumption is generally safe, but excessive intake is linked to weight gain, type 2 diabetes,
dental caries, and cardiovascular risks. Overconsumption can also lead to obesity, insulin
resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Dental caries are also a significant concern due to
sucrose’s fermentation by oral bacteria.

**Natural Occurrence:** Sugarcane stalks contain 12-20% sucrose
by weight, making it a primary commercial source. The plant, native to Southeast Asia, is
cultivated to tropical regions like Brazil, India, and the Caribbean. In sugarcane, sucrose is
stored in the stalks, then refined to isolate it as white or brown sugar.
**Appearance:** Juicy, fibrous stalks, which are
green to brownish and segmented. Sugarcane juice is a cloudy, sweet liquid (10-15% sucrose)
that turns brownish when processed into molasses or raw sugar.

## History

Sugarcane was first domesticated in New Guinea around 8000 BCE and spread to India, where the process of crystallizing sugar was developed around 350 CE. Arab traders brought sugar production techniques to the Mediterranean, and European colonial powers established massive sugar plantations in the Caribbean and Americas from the 16th century onward, fueling the transatlantic slave trade. Sugar became one of the most influential commodities in world history, transforming global economies, diets, and public health, and its overconsumption is now linked to the modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes.
