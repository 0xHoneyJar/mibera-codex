# Alcohol

## Effects & Properties

**Effects:** Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. In small
amounts, it produces relaxation, lowered inhibitions and mild euphoria. In higher doses, it
impairs motor skills, judgment, and can cause intoxication, nausea, or unconsciousness.

**Natural Occurrence:** Alcohol occurs naturally through
fermentation, where microorganisms like yeast convert sugars into ethanol and CO2. It’s found
in trace amounts in overripe fruits, fermented plant saps, or natural beverages like kombucha.
**Appearance:** Clear, colorless liquid at room
temperature with a slightly sweet, alcoholic odor and a burning taste.

## History

Archaeological evidence suggests that fermented beverages were produced as early as 7000 BCE in Jiahu, China, making alcohol one of the oldest psychoactive substances known to humanity. Alcohol has been central to virtually every major civilization, from Sumerian beer to Egyptian wine to European distilled spirits developed by Arab alchemists around the 8th century CE. Prohibition in the United States (1920-1933) demonstrated the impossibility of suppressing its use, and alcohol remains the most widely consumed legal intoxicant globally.
