# MiReveal #3.3

> **Phase 5** · MIREVEAL3.3 · [All Fractures →](README.md)

Mibera takes on a more coherent form in this phase and begins to reveal their astrology. Their eyes are closed, face expressionless — the hope here is for Miladies to wonder: "When will Mibera wake up?"

### What's Revealed

- Mibera's form becomes coherent
- [Astrology](../traits/overlays/astrology/README.md) begins to show — sun sign visible
- Eyes closed, face expressionless — still sleeping
