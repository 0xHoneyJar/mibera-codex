# MiParcels

> **Phase 1** · MIPARCEL · [All Fractures →](README.md)

Sealed envelopes covered in various labels, stickers, and handwritten scrawl from the Mibera lore. The first thing holders see is a package — not a being, not even a promise of one. Just anticipation in physical form.

MiParcels is pure mystery. No hint of what's inside, no preview of the Mibera to come. The parcel itself is the art — a sealed container that asks you to trust the process.
