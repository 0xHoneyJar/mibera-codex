> **Phase 2** · MILADIES · [All Fractures →](README.md)

Horizontally flipped Milady Maker art with toilet graffiti scrawled on top. Before Mibera can exist, it must acknowledge where it came from — and deface it.

The Miladies phase is a bridge between lineages. Milady had to die so that Milady may live. This phase crystallizes that transition: familiar art, mirrored and vandalized, marking the moment the Mibera identity begins to diverge from its ancestor.
