# Fractures — The Reveal Timeline

*10 soulbound collections marking each phase of Mibera's emergence into the world.*

---

## Overview

FracturedMibera is a set of 10 soulbound ERC-721 collections on Berachain. Each represents a reveal phase — a step in the progression from sealed envelope to fully-realized Mibera. They serve as permanent on-chain proof of which reveal wave a holder participated in.

Every Mibera holder can mint their corresponding token ID in each Fracture collection. The tokens are non-transferable — permanently bound to the minting wallet as a record of presence.

## The Reveal Phases

The reveal unfolds in 10 stages. The first two phases — MiParcels and Miladies — are conceptual predecessors: pure anticipation and a nod to lineage. The remaining eight are the progressive unveiling of the Mibera form.

| # | Phase | Symbol | What's Revealed |
|---|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | [MiParcels](miparcels.md) | MIPARCEL | Sealed envelopes — labels, stickers, lore scrawl |
| 2 | [Miladies](miladies.md) | MILADIES | Flipped Milady Maker art with toilet graffiti |
| 3 | [MiReveal #1.1](mireveal-1.1.md) | MIREVEAL1.1 | Colors and scenery — first hints, rare foregrounds |
| 4 | [MiReveal #2.2](mireveal-2.2.md) | MIREVEAL2.2 | Scene clears, molecule placed, silhouette appears |
| 5 | [MiReveal #3.3](mireveal-3.3.md) | MIREVEAL3.3 | Form takes shape, astrology revealed, eyes closed |
| 6 | [MiReveal #4.20](mireveal-4.20.md) | MIREVEAL4.20 | Moon appears, hat placed if applicable |
| 7 | [MiReveal #5.5](mireveal-5.5.md) | MIREVEAL5.5 | Mibera awakes — rising sign, face finalized |
| 8 | [MiReveal #6.9](mireveal-6.9.md) | MIREVEAL6.9 | Head takes final form, ancient emblem appears |
| 9 | [MiReveal #7.7](mireveal-7.7.md) | MIREVEAL7.7 | Tattoos added — calm before the storm |
| 10 | [MiReveal #8.8](mireveal-8.8.md) | MIREVEAL8.8 | Final reveal — the current Mibera collection |

### The Naming Convention

The decimal numbering is playful and intentional: 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, **4.20**, 5.5, **6.9**, 7.7, 8.8. The cultural references in 4.20 and 6.9 are deliberate.

## Contracts

All 10 Fracture collections are soulbound ERC-721 contracts on Berachain, deployed from a single script. Token IDs mirror the main Mibera collection 1:1.
