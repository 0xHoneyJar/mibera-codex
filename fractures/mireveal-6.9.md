# MiReveal #6.9

> **Phase 8** · MIREVEAL6.9 · [All Fractures →](README.md)

Mibera has become rather comfortable, as their head has now taken its final form. The overlay will remain the same for most — but those with an ancient emblem will get to see it in the lower right corner. This will be the only point at which anyone gets to see the naked ancient emblem.

### What's Revealed

- Head takes **final form** — [hair](../traits/character-traits/hair/README.md), complete silhouette
- Ancient emblem visible in lower right corner (if applicable)
- The only phase where the ancient emblem appears unadorned
