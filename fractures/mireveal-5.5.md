# MiReveal #5.5

> **Phase 7** · MIREVEAL5.5 · [All Fractures →](README.md)

With the rising sign now visible, Miladies should be aware that Mibera is awake at last — as if their now open eyes did not make that obvious already. As they start to take in the scene around them, their mouth takes its final shape and their face and ears are adorned accordingly. Mibera is starting to feel ready for the world, but is the world ready for Mibera?

### What's Revealed

- Mibera **wakes up** — eyes open
- [Rising sign](../traits/overlays/astrology/README.md) becomes visible
