# MiReveal #1.1

> **Phase 3** · MIREVEAL1.1 · [All Fractures →](README.md)

The first thing Miladies see upon opening their package is a smattering of colors and only the promise of a Mibera. This stage is meant to evoke some amount of uncertainty, but also give a substantial enough hint about what sort of scenery is surrounding Mibera.

In fact, Mibera may be found behind a rare foreground at this phase. GG to those who have been seeking some certainty.

### What's Revealed

- Background colors and scenery hints
- Rare foregrounds visible for some Miberas
