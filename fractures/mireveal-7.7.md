# MiReveal #7.7

> **Phase 9** · MIREVEAL7.7 · [All Fractures →](README.md)

Many Miberas will decide to get a tattoo before the final reveal, showing Miladies more of their unique personhood. This phase is decidedly calm before the next. The contrast it creates should be palpable.

### What's Revealed

- [Tattoos](../traits/character-traits/tattoos/README.md) applied (for those who have them)
- A deliberately quiet phase — the calm before the storm
