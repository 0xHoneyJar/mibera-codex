# MiReveal #4.20

> **Phase 6** · MIREVEAL4.20 · [All Fractures →](README.md)

Mibera continues to sleep as the moon shows itself, though if they have a hat then it is gently placed on their head. Many Miberas will not have said hat. The amount of color this adds to the overall collection upon this phase warrants the hat being the only real visual addition to Mibera.

### What's Revealed

- Moon appears in the scene
- [Hat](../traits/accessories/hats/README.md) placed (if applicable — many Miberas go hatless)
- Mibera still sleeping
