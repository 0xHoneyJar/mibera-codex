# Mireveal Stages

*The progressive reveal system for Mibera NFTs.*

---

## Overview

Miberas are revealed through a multi-stage system, each stage adding more detail and complexity to the artwork. The reveal process mirrors the journey of awakening — from shadow to full manifestation.

---

## Stage 1.1 — The Shadow

**Theme:** Emergence from the Cave

**Visible Elements:**
- Basic silhouette
- Background hints
- [Add details once confirmed]

## Stage 2.2 — The Outline

## Technical Implementation

Reveal images are stored at:
```
https://mibera.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/mireveal{version}/{imageHash}.webp
```

Each Mibera has a unique image hash that remains consistent across all reveal stages, allowing collectors to track their specific Mibera through the reveal journey.

---

## Adding Images

To add example images for each stage:

1. Upload representative images for each reveal stage
2. Update the placeholder text above with the actual image paths
3. Consider adding a gallery of 3-4 examples per stage showing variety
