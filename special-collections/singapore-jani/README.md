# Singapore Jani Masks

**Type:** 1/1 Masks

Two unique masks named after Jani (deepname99), the founder and philosophical architect of Mibera. Both masks are custom-made pieces that Jani wore at [Token 2049 Singapore](https://www.token2049.com/) in 2024. Both masks were subsequently stolen.

Each mask appears on exactly one Mibera out of 10,000. Both carry a swag score of 5 (max for masks).

## The Two Masks

| Mask | Mibera | Swag Score | Mibera Rank | Mibera Score |
|------|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| [Singapore Jani 1](../../traits/accessories/masks/singapore-jani-1.md) | [#7797](../../miberas/7797.md) | 5 | D | 13 |
| [Singapore Jani 2](../../traits/accessories/masks/singapore-jani-2.md) | [#6426](../../miberas/6426.md) | 5 | D | 8 |

## Why Rank D?

Despite both masks having the maximum swag score (5), both Miberas landed at Rank D. The [swag scoring formula](../../swag-scoring/README.md) is dominated by the multiplicative core — `item × shirt × drug` — and additive mask bonuses can't overcome low rolls there:

- **#7797:** (2 × 2 × 2) + 5 = **13**
- **#6426:** (1 × 3 × 1) + 5 = **8**

Truly bad luck for the Singapore Jani masks all around — custom-made, worn by the founder, stolen in real life, and cursed with D-rank Miberas.

See [Issue #22](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/mibera-codex/issues/22) for the full investigation.
