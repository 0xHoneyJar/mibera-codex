# Milady 1-of-1s

**Type:** Tribute, 1/1

Five custom Miberas created as direct tributes to specific [Milady Maker](https://miladymaker.net/) NFTs and their stories. Each is a hand-crafted 1-of-1 within the 10,000 generative collection — all share the [Milady](../core-lore/archetypes.md#milady) archetype and [Rank F](../traits/overlays/ranking/f.md) ("Special").

Unlike the [42 Grails](../grails/README.md), which are fully hand-drawn 1/1 art pieces, Milady 1-of-1s are generative Miberas with unique traits that appear nowhere else in the collection. Every trait exclusive to a Milady 1-of-1 exists on exactly one token out of 10,000.

## The Five Milady 1-of-1s

### Drippy Milady — Mibera [#7453](../miberas/7453.md)

**Based on:** [Milady #5930](https://opensea.io/item/ethereum/0x5af0d9827e0c53e4799bb226655a1de152a425a5/5930)

A tribute to a very high drip Milady. Mibera #7453 carries the most unique traits of any single token in the collection — six traits that exist on no other Mibera:

| Unique Trait | Category |
|-------------|----------|
| Milady 5930 Crescent And Dots | Face Accessory |
| Tennis Outfit | Shirt |
| Raised | Eyebrows |
| Line | Mouth |

A memorial tribute to Stratt, a beloved Milady community member who passed away. Stratt spawned the "share a butterfly with me" meme that became a lasting piece of Milady cultural memory.

A tribute to Todd Fine ([@tfinesol](https://x.com/tfinesol)), a prolific Milady community member, writer, activist, and self-described "crypto villain." Fine is known for his critical, sardonic commentary on crypto culture, published across Hyperallergic, HuffPost, and The Indypendent.

### Lazarus — Mibera [#3264](../miberas/3264.md)

A tribute to Milady #602, which is held in a wallet controlled by North Korea's [Lazarus Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group) — the state-sponsored hacking organization behind the Ronin Bridge exploit of March 2022 (~$600 million in damages) and the $1.5 billion Bybit hack of 2025. Milady #602 was swept up in the Ronin exploit and now sits in a Lazarus-controlled address, effectively a hostage NFT held by North Korean state hackers.

## Shared Characteristics

All five Milady 1-of-1s share:

- **Archetype:** [Milady](../core-lore/archetypes.md#milady) (Capricorn/Aquarius/Pisces)
- **Swag Rank:** [F](../traits/overlays/ranking/f.md) — the "Special" tier, reserved for tokens that operate outside the normal scoring system
- **Time Period:** Modern
- **Low Swag Scores:** Ranging from 2–7, reflecting the F-rank's independence from the multiplicative [swag scoring formula](../swag-scoring/README.md)

## How to Identify a Milady 1-of-1

If a Mibera has:
1. **Milady archetype** + **Rank F**
2. One or more traits that appear on **no other token** in the collection
3. A trait name that references a specific Milady token ID (e.g., "Milady 5930 Crescent And Dots")

...it is one of the five Milady 1-of-1 tributes documented here.
