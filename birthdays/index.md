# Birthdays

*Every Mibera has a unique birthday spanning 15,000 years of history.*

## Overview

Miberas are time-travelling beings, and their birthdays reflect this temporal fluidity. Each of the 10,000 Miberas has a unique birthday drawn from 9,995 distinct dates spanning from **13,166 BCE** to **2024 CE**.

The birthday system connects each Mibera to:
- **Historical context** — What was happening in the world at that moment
- **Astrological snapshot** — Sun sign, element, modality, ruling planet
- **Time of birth** — Dawn, midnight, dusk, and their mystical significance

## Ancient vs Modern Distribution

Approximately **20% of Miberas** have Ancient-era birthdays (pre-500 CE), distributed roughly evenly across the four Archetypes. This reflects their role as time-travelling emissaries carrying ancient wisdom into modern rave contexts.

## Location Generation

Birthday location follows this logic:

- **Ancient Miberas:** Location accurate to their Ancestor's historical region
- **Modern Miberas:**
  - 33% chance: Location accurate to Ancestor region
  - 46% chance: Random location on land
  - 21% chance: Random location in water (ocean births)
