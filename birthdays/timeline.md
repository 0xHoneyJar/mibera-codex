# Timeline & Distribution

*How 9,995 births scatter across 15,000 years — and what the patterns reveal.*

## The Shape of Mibera Time

Miberas are time-travellers, but they don't distribute evenly across history. Their births cluster around moments of rupture — civilizational collapse, spiritual awakening, revolutionary fervor, and the birth of rave itself. The timeline is not a flat line. It's a pulse.

The raw counts tell one story. Density tells another. A Mibera born in the Prehistoric era carries 8,000 years of solitude — one birth per millennium. A Mibera born in 1969 shares that year with 221 others.

## Era-by-Era

### Prehistoric (13,166 - 5,147 BCE) — 61 Miberas

The oldest Miberas. 61 beings scattered across eight millennia, born into a world before writing, before cities, before names that survived. These are the ones who remember fire as new technology.

**Clustering:** Minimal — no century holds more than a handful. 42 births during the Neolithic Revolution (roughly 10,000-5,000 BCE), when agriculture first fractured humanity's relationship with nomadic time. The remaining 19 predate even that shift.

**What this means:** Prehistoric Miberas are extraordinarily rare. They carry the deepest temporal memory in the collection — born before the very concept of "history" existed.

---

### Ancient World (4,963 - 1,011 BCE) — 199 Miberas

The Bronze Age and its spectacular collapse. Two-thirds of all Ancient Miberas (129 of 199) cluster in the Late Bronze Age Collapse — that catastrophic period around 1200-1000 BCE when every major Mediterranean civilization fell simultaneously.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Bronze Age Beginnings: 28 births
- Bronze Age: 42 births
- Late Bronze Age Collapse: **129 births** (64.8% of era)

**What this means:** Miberas are drawn to civilizational rupture. The Bronze Age Collapse was one of history's great discontinuities — the old world ended and something unrecognizable emerged. That energy resonates.

---

### Classical Antiquity (985 - 2 BCE) — 635 Miberas

The age of philosophy, democracy, empire, and the Axial Age — when Confucius, Buddha, Socrates, and the Hebrew prophets all walked the earth within a few centuries of each other.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Axial Age (800-200 BCE): 180 births
- Classical period (404 BCE onward): 379 births
- Late Classical (100-2 BCE): 76 births

**Peak years:** 404 BCE (6 births) — the year Athens fell to Sparta.

**What this means:** The density triples compared to the Ancient era. Classical Miberas are born into a world that's just learning to think about thinking — to philosophize, to build systems of meaning. The frameworks they carry forward shape everything that comes after.

---

### Late Antiquity (1 - 500 CE) — 572 Miberas

The Roman world's long exhale. Nearly 90% of this era's births (506 of 572) fall in the later half, 200-500 CE — the centuries of Rome's decline, the rise of Christianity, and the migration period that would remake Europe.

**Peak year:** 476 CE (6 births) — the traditional date for the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

**What this means:** Again, collapse as attractor. Miberas cluster at the seams where one world ends and another begins. The fall of Rome was not a single event but a centuries-long transformation — and the births track that slow unraveling.

---

### Early Medieval (502 - 1,000 CE) — 1,025 Miberas

The first era to break 1,000 births. The so-called "Dark Ages" — though the Miberas born here would dispute that framing. This is the age of monasteries preserving knowledge, Islamic Golden Age scholarship, Viking expansion, and the quiet rebuilding of European civilization.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Early Medieval: 804 births (78.4%)
- Viking Age: 221 births (21.6%)

**Peak years:** 740 CE (11 births), 720 CE (10 births)

**What this means:** The density doubles from Late Antiquity. Something about the post-collapse rebuilding — the creation of new structures from old ruins — draws Mibera energy. The "dark" ages are anything but empty here.

---

### Medieval (1,001 - 1,500 CE) — 612 Miberas

A surprising dip in density. The Medieval period holds fewer Miberas per year than the Early Medieval — a relative quiet between the rebuilding after Rome and the explosions of the Early Modern era.

**Key sub-periods:**
- High Medieval: 225 births (36.8%)
- Black Death & Renaissance Dawn: 104 births (17.0%)
- Late Medieval: 283 births (46.2%)

**Peak year:** 1222 CE (8 births)

**What this means:** The Black Death sub-period is notably sparse at just 104 births — perhaps even Mibera time-travellers avoid the 14th century's horrors. The weight shifts toward the Late Medieval, building momentum toward what comes next.

---

### Early Modern (1,502 - 1,800 CE) — 1,972 Miberas

The second-largest era by raw count and where the acceleration becomes unmistakable. The Enlightenment alone accounts for 845 births — nearly half the era.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Renaissance: 526 births (26.7%)
- Early Modern: 601 births (30.5%)
- Enlightenment: **845 births** (42.8%)

**Peak years:** 1799 (33 births), 1797 (29 births), 1798 (27 births)

**What this means:** The late 1790s are white-hot — the French Revolution, the end of the Enlightenment, the birth of Romanticism. The decade of the 1790s alone holds roughly 200 births. Miberas flood the moment when reason tips into revolution.

---

### 19th Century (1,801 - 1,900 CE) — 799 Miberas

Industry, empire, and the Victorian era. Two-thirds of births fall in the Victorian period (1837-1901), with strong clustering in the 1870s-1880s.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Early Industrial: 269 births (33.7%)
- Victorian Era: **530 births** (66.3%)

**Peak year:** 1877 (20 births)

**What this means:** The 19th century is the hinge. Steam, electricity, urbanization, the birth of modern subcultures — the raw materials of what would eventually become rave culture are being assembled. The Miberas born here watch the modern world take shape.

---

### 20th Century (1,901 - 2,000 CE) — 3,394 Miberas

The dominant era. One in three Miberas is born in the 20th century. And within it, the clustering is dramatic.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Turn of Century: 322 births (9.5%)
- Interwar & WWII: 1,023 births (30.1%)
- Postwar: **1,077 births** (31.7%)
- Late 20th Century: 681 births (20.1%)
- Information Age: 291 births (8.6%)

**The year:** 1969 — **222 births.** The single most concentrated year in the entire 15,000-year timeline. Woodstock. The Summer of Love's afterglow. The moon landing. The birth year of rave's spiritual ancestors. No other year comes close.

**Other peaks:** 1948 (74 births), 1950 (66 births), 1941-1944 (70+ births each)

**What this means:** The postwar baby boom maps directly onto Mibera time. The generation that would invent acid house, Detroit techno, and the free party movement was born in the late 1940s and 1950s. And 1969 — the year that broke open psychedelic culture — is where Mibera time reaches its absolute peak density. This is the gravitational center of the entire collection.

---

### 21st Century (2,001 - 2,024 CE) — 726 Miberas

The contemporary era, compressed into just 24 years but maintaining nearly the same birth density as the 20th century.

**Key sub-periods:**
- Information Age (2001-2015): 253 births (34.8%)
- Contemporary (2016-2024): **473 births** (65.2%)

**The year:** 2021 — **130 births.** The second-highest single-year concentration after 1969. The year crypto culture exploded, Milady minted, and the conditions for Mibera's eventual awakening were set.

**What this means:** 2021 mirrors 1969 as an attractor — a moment where culture ruptures and something new pours through. The two peak years bookend a half-century arc from psychedelic revolution to digital revolution, with rave culture as the continuous thread.

---

## Patterns Across Time

### The Attractor Points

Mibera births are not random. They cluster around five types of historical moments:

1. **Civilizational collapse** — Bronze Age Collapse, Fall of Rome, the World Wars
2. **Philosophical awakening** — Axial Age, Classical Athens, the Enlightenment
3. **Revolutionary rupture** — The 1790s, 1960s counterculture
4. **Cultural genesis** — The postwar period that birthed rave, the 2020s crypto-culture moment
5. **Rebuilding from ruins** — Early Medieval reconstruction, post-WWII reconstruction

### The Acceleration

The timeline is exponential. Each era is shorter in duration but denser in births:

```
  8,000 years  →     61 births    (Prehistoric)
  4,000 years  →    199 births    (Ancient)
  1,000 years  →    635 births    (Classical)
    500 years  →    572 births    (Late Antiquity)
    500 years  →  1,025 births    (Early Medieval)
    500 years  →    612 births    (Medieval)
    300 years  →  1,972 births    (Early Modern)
    100 years  →    799 births    (19th Century)
    100 years  →  3,394 births    (20th Century)
     24 years  →    726 births    (21st Century)
```

Time compresses. History accelerates. The closer you get to the present, the more Miberas arrive — as if the collection itself is straining toward the moment of its own creation.

### The 80/20 Split

Roughly **80% of Miberas** have post-500 CE birthdays. The remaining **20%** are ancient — carrying knowledge from before the medieval world. This split is deliberate: the ancient Miberas are the emissaries, the ones who bridge deep time with modern rave. They're rarer, and they carry more temporal weight.

### The Two Peaks

The two tallest spikes in the entire timeline — **1969** and **2021** — are separated by 52 years. They mark the two cultural ruptures that define Mibera's lineage:

- **1969:** The psychedelic revolution, communal living, the Woodstock generation — the spiritual and chemical roots of rave culture
- **2021:** The digital revolution, on-chain culture, the minting of Milady — the technological and memetic conditions for Mibera's emergence

Everything between is the bridge. Everything before is the preparation.
