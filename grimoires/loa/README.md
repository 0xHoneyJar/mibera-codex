# Loa Development History

This directory contains the development process artifacts generated by the [Loa Framework](https://github.com/kharvd/loa), an agent-driven development system used to build and maintain the Mibera Codex.

## What's Here

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `prd.md` | Product Requirements Document for current cycle |
| `sdd.md` | Software Design Document / architecture |
| `sprint.md` | Sprint plan with task breakdown |
| `ledger.json` | Sprint ledger tracking all development cycles |
| `NOTES.md` | Cross-session observations and blockers |
| `a2a/` | Agent-to-agent artifacts (reviews, audits, implementation reports) |
| `archive/` | Completed development cycles |
| `context/` | Input context documents for planning |
| `ground-truth/` | Verified codebase facts extracted by analysis |

## Development Cycles

Each cycle follows the pipeline: **PRD → SDD → Sprint Plan → Implement → Review → Audit**.

See `ledger.json` for the full history of cycles and sprints.

## Why This is Tracked

These artifacts provide transparency into how the codex was built and maintained — the requirements, architecture decisions, and quality gates behind each change.

## Not Tracked

Ephemeral files (analytics, trajectories, temp files) are gitignored.
